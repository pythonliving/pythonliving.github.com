<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5012864614836872" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Disclaimer: This blog was written previous to the initial launch of BLTP.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Gimp, my new best friend. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been playing around with Gimp, making backgrounds and other helpful things for my things for my Blog. &nbsp;And finally, my blog in it&rsquo;s entirety is coming around. Hopefully soon I will be able to post my first real entry. &nbsp;By the time you read this you will have seen my backgrounds and other such works for a while, but let me tell you, there&rsquo;s been lots of head banging (see the non-international version of this phrase for clarification, aka banging of head). Learning how to use CSS and HTML has been the main culprit. &nbsp;Learning about nesting and how things are set together, that has by far been the part that comes in phases. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been steered towards some very useful resources, so for those of you who want to learn how to make your own website definitely look at </span><a href="http://w3schools.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">W3schools</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> and </span><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">CSS Zen Garden</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;For those of you who already know how to, please let me know of any resources you use that you find helpful. &nbsp;I am all ears.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In learning about HTML and CSS, I&rsquo;ve seen just how much can be done within the CSS in making a simple HTML look fantastic. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m interested in learning how Javascript plays a role as well, but want to have a firmer grasp before I delve into it. &nbsp;For those of you who use Javascript, what do you find it useful for? &nbsp;Is it something that helps more with animation, or do you find that it simplifies other tasks as well?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One item that I need to work on is my ability to set up HTML more simplistically. I&rsquo;m constantly loosing track of my divs. &nbsp;</span><br /><br />
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A div is a term that is used to help identify different sections of your webpage. &nbsp;To use a div you must start it and end it. If you don&rsquo;t end it, whatever coloring theme you have in that section will continue down the rest of the page. &nbsp;In other words, never loose track of your divs.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve got this odd slight setting to the right on a couple of pages I built for the FlamingLunchbox website. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been told (Robey, or partner), that it must be my divs. &nbsp;Honestly, I&rsquo;m afraid to look at the page. &nbsp;The coloring scheme I set up uses divs all over the place and it makes viewing that page a pain. &nbsp;And as it goes, it seems that an increase in divs encourages severe head banging. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
