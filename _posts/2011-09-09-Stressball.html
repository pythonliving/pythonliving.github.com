<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8730812463909388" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I spent one day up in Portland, walking around, enjoying coffee and random treats with a couple of very good friends, and then I came back home. &nbsp;First thing this morning, two calls regarding bills. &nbsp;Now I&rsquo;m horridly stressed. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What do I do to deal with the stress? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaction #1: Almost take it out on my co-worker. &nbsp;Luckily I was able to keep it in check, despite it all occurring during a conversation I already have difficulties dealing with. &nbsp;That is, a conversation where my programming entries are reviewed for grammar, understanding, and readability. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a conversation that occurs to make sure I actually understand what I&rsquo;m trying to explain. &nbsp;That....was hard.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaction #2: Use my normal distraction tactic, watch a TV episode to get my mind of things so I can get back to work. &nbsp;Although it does help me distract myself, it doesn&rsquo;t always help me get back to work. &nbsp;It can also leave me feeling less than able to do my job, once finished. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Needless to say, that wasn&rsquo;t what happened.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaction #3: Go on a walk to the bank and deposit my check. &nbsp;This may sound like the best option, but I know I&rsquo;ll just start thinking about it more and stressing out about it on the way there. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only a 10 minute walk, but it&rsquo;s enough time to allow a mini freak-out session on the way back, which will mean only more stress and avoidance. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Instead I biked there, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have all the time to think about it. &nbsp;That worked out better.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaction #4: Talk about my stress with my co-worker. &nbsp;This will probably encourage both of us to continue to be stressed for another couple of hours, as we get over the stress about bills together. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So...not good.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaction #5: Bottle it up, because honestly, what other option sounds good right now? &nbsp;I can either distract myself from the stress, or talk about it. &nbsp;Both of those are probably not going to help with solving the problem. &nbsp;However this allows for the negative effect of poor reactions/stressing issues for anything else that happens today. &nbsp;Not to mention that any distraction tactic is simply going to end up bottling it up in the process. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I always bottle it up for a little bit.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Where did this all come from? &nbsp;My dislike of the breathing method to calm ones-self down. &nbsp;I understand it&rsquo;s for the prevention of gut-induced reactions that produce job-loss, and to calm yourself down, but it still seems such a simple way to deal with it. &nbsp;So simple it feels like it never works for me. &nbsp;Perhaps I have too much anger at this point in my life? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know...How do you deal with stress other than taking care of the things that stress you out? &nbsp;Do you have other tricks that help you to recover when you become angry? &nbsp;</span></div>
