<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7099796119146049" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes when I program, it flows well and I seem to get everything. &nbsp;Other times, I feel like nothing makes sense, and then it all cascades downhill into a swampy, sticky mess. &nbsp;Then it seems that more and more of the problem is not working, and it becomes more convoluted, and my frustration increases. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I just spent my morning allotment of programming time on one problem. &nbsp;When I first started I thought the final bits were sitting right in front of me, and that I would be able to complete it in no time. &nbsp;Then as time wore on it became more complicated, I started to rewrite my code over and over. &nbsp;By the end of it, after asking for help multiple times, I felt like I was just banging my head against a wall, and I was almost ready to cry. &nbsp;Why wasn&rsquo;t I understanding it? &nbsp;What wasn&rsquo;t clicking? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This problem that I&rsquo;m talking about, that is causing me so much pain and anguish, is the culmination of the recent problem set I&rsquo;ve been working on. &nbsp;This particular problem is using a part of coding I haven&rsquo;t yet used before, and it&rsquo;s proving to be a challenge. &nbsp;This part is called </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search#Implementations"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">binary search</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;Anyways, when I went to the wiki it didn&rsquo;t help that the main example I looked at was written in Pascal (different programming language) which I tried to interpret. &nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t work out so well. &nbsp;That same example was also written to be used against an array, which was also not helpful. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was hoping to finish that piece of code, and write up my final blog entries for the problem set today. &nbsp;Suffice it to say I&rsquo;m still not finished. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m fairly frustrated at the moment, but I decided to take some time before I dive back in. &nbsp;I think I might go on a bike ride to let the stress fizzle away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
