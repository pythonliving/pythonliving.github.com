<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9228379635605961" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As I&rsquo;ve been learning to program, there have been some personal hurdles that I&rsquo;ve run into that have made it harder to progress. &nbsp;These vary from simple background education, or lack of, to overcoming personal beliefs.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Was math a problem?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m a woman, but that age old adage &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do math because my brain isn&rsquo;t set up that way&rdquo; was never something that even entered my mind. &nbsp;I honestly really have issues with women who try to get away with that excuse when it comes to learning math. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just so stupid. &nbsp;I spent most of my youth in creative pursuits, learning music and producing music, writing and learning other languages. &nbsp;Those pursuits never interfered from my ability to learn math. &nbsp;I also never had any teachers that I can remember, who felt that women were less capable when it came to learning mathematics. &nbsp;I feel that these two aspects are important to understand for my next statement to be taken at face value.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I have never felt I couldn&rsquo;t do math, but I always felt like math was an option I could always pursue when I felt like it. &nbsp;One never has a problem finding a math course, almost wherever you go. &nbsp;When I was in college all I wanted to do was learn things that I might not have access to later in life. &nbsp;Therefore I learned about languages, alive and dead, history and culture. &nbsp;I studied subjects less common because they were interesting. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to do anything with my degree beyond satisfy my own need to learn. &nbsp;Anyways, so the base point, I never took any math in college. &nbsp;When I started programming I was 5 years out of my undergraduate degree, and I had just taken Math 111 and 112 at the local community college. &nbsp;Getting over my symbol shock took a bit, because it had been a while. &nbsp;But that was it, that is my background in mathematics.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That simple lack in a sufficient mathematical background made me apprehensive at first when I decided to learn to program. &nbsp;I knew that it would be logic and math heavy, but I knew that I was intellectually capable and that I had a math grad student (Robey) to help me out when I needed. &nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s why, in some ways, when I was presented with one of the first Problem Set&rsquo;s I fought it. &nbsp;It was regarding prime numbers. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t fight it because I felt incapable of learning and using math, but because of my recognition of just how much I didn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Learning to stay focused by using music</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Another hurdle that presented itself was learning how to use the energy and creativity of music while still being able to think. &nbsp;That took time. &nbsp;While I was still getting over programming symbol shock it was almost impossible to listen to music while trying to program. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that I truly felt able to program while listening to music. &nbsp;Once I was able to do so, I saw an increase in the amount I programmed, and in the enjoyment from programming. &nbsp;I definitely started feeling the creativity of the music and the energy, and my code thus improved. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s all I can think of for now. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll keep you posted as I realize/jump more hurdles.</span></div>
