<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.9941635329741985"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In all honesty, mostly feeling sorry for myself. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been hit on and off with smaller bouts of depression over the past two weeks. &nbsp;Luckily I&rsquo;ve been able to continue with work for the most part, but the depression is starting to get a tad oppressive. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve had some family stressors as well, and those have been livening things up a bit. &nbsp;Mainly it&rsquo;s all about an almost teenage boy (my nephew). &nbsp;He&rsquo;s very important to me and some of the things that happened lately had to happen, and they weren&rsquo;t pretty. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also seemed of late, that so many of my friends&rsquo; lives are drastically changing. &nbsp;Changing in ways that make me sad, even though the changes are conscious decisions and not injured limbs or otherwise uncontrolled occurrences. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I mentioned recently that I&rsquo;ve been reading a fair amount. &nbsp;Let me rephrase that, I&rsquo;ve been reading a ridiculous amount. &nbsp;David Eddings and Brandon Sanderson have been my companions of late, as they&rsquo;ve aided my escape from reality. &nbsp;My neck and shoulders are sore from the constant poses I use when reading books in either our chairs or in the bed. &nbsp;My feet are constantly annoyed at that clammy feeling you get when they sweat inside your bedsheets.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">All of this depression and self loathing has made me quite sick of myself. &nbsp;The fact that I recognize my bad habits doesn&rsquo;t help any either. &nbsp;I stress eat, and it&rsquo;s been happening. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m keeping it in check, but it&rsquo;s horribly demoralizing to know that one of the bad habits you have which seems to combat stress so well is one that makes you fat. &nbsp;So I&rsquo;ve been consuming peppermint tea and taking baths more than normal to try to let the stress melt away. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;kind of&lsquo; working. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I don&rsquo;t really know what a weekend feels like anymore because I almost never get two days in a row when I don&rsquo;t feel like I need to be working. &nbsp;Even on the days I take as my &lsquo;weekend&rsquo; &nbsp;I feel like I&rsquo;m doing something wrong and so I still stress about it all day long. &nbsp;Humorous how my recent blog entries about recovery and learning how to understand ones self have borne an entry about self loathing and depression. &nbsp;I long for an escape from these feelings and yet I have full control over my life. &nbsp;I have full control over the actions that make me feel this way, but I continue to be a flake. &nbsp;I continue to self-degrade while day-dreaming. &nbsp;I continue to eat more than necessary, anything to make these feelings go away. &nbsp;But the stories, they seem to be my only solace. &nbsp;And so I return back to my adventure novels, and I escape from reality for just a little bit more.</span></strong></p>
