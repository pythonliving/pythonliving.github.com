<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.04066707147285342" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most days I wake up and feel like I really don&rsquo;t know anything. &nbsp;Which in such situations, honestly, my partner doesn&rsquo;t help. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s been studying computers and computer languages for years now. &nbsp;So, because I&rsquo;m trying to learn something totally new previous to my former education, I consistently feel...incapable. &nbsp;Unfortunately my own personal drive creates this internal expectation that I can and should be able to do it all already. &nbsp;Which in turn makes the trying and doing fairly difficult, as I consistently get re-slammed with the idea of not knowin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Today was one of those days where I worked all day long on something only to find at the end of the day that I&rsquo;m going to have to start all over. &nbsp;At least that&rsquo;s the way it feels. &nbsp;At this point I&rsquo;m going to need to rework quite a bit on my current project. So now, after working for 9 hours on the project, it was fairly disheartening to realize all the work I would need to do. &nbsp;Normally I consider myself to be the kind of person who thinks about everything she needs to ahead of time, and knows that if she didn&rsquo;t think about it then she&rsquo;ll try to do something about it when it comes up. &nbsp;If she can. &nbsp;If not, then she&rsquo;ll just move on and do the best she can with what she&rsquo;s got. &nbsp;What else can you do really, really? &nbsp;I find many people who continuously prevent themselves from finishing a project because they find other things wrong with it, or they are simply people who can&rsquo;t live with the fact that they are human. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry, I will do my best the first time I make it for you, and if there is time I will redo it. &nbsp;Otherwise we&rsquo;ll address it during the next time around. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">However the more I read in the field of Computer Science, the more I realize that many of the great leaps and innovations in this industry have been reworked hundreds of times, by multitudes of people. &nbsp;And this is the line of work I&rsquo;m moving towards. &nbsp;I know this will be one of my biggest challenges. &nbsp;I will have to learn to make mistakes, day in and day out, and consistently not let it hit me. &nbsp;I will do them again and again until I get it right. &nbsp;That kind of problem solving is what I need to make this business work. &nbsp;Even saying all of this makes me feel slightly stupid, because you always hear those quotes about how only the great things come from banging your head on a door time and again. &nbsp;But as to whether or not that is a feat my burly strength is capable of? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Who knows...</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></div>
