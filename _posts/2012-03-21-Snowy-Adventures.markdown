It's snowing.  It's been snowing for over a day now.  It seems rather fitting as over a year ago it snowed on almost the same day here in the valley.  It feels odd to see the thick flakes drift down.  The valley doesn't normally get such heavy snow fall.  

Snow and being outside just makes me yearn for an adventure.  Sometimes I wonder if there is something inherent in some people that makes them want to see the world.  Many days I see pictures and images and I just want to go!  Get out!  Come back in weeks, more like months.

But I'm stuck at home translating and crocheting, and watching TV as the snow piles up.  Soon I'll be able to start running again but for now all I can do is stare out at the bright night.
