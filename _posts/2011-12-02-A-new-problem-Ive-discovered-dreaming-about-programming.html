<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I first started learning German I was in high school. &nbsp;I only took about two years, and honestly I wasn&rsquo;t an amazingly devoted student. &nbsp;Then my junior year I traveled to Germany and lived there for a year as an exchange student. &nbsp;My inability to speak was frighteningly apparent, and I quickly started to cram as much vocabulary into my brain as possible. &nbsp;This, accompanied with tutoring from my math teacher at the Gymnasium (because she couldn&rsquo;t speak any English (only Russian), and I couldn&rsquo;t understand her mathematics class well enough for her taste), meant I learnt and I learnt fast. &nbsp;At 4 months I could carry on a decent conversation, albeit a limited one. &nbsp;I remember going to an event hosted by my exchange program where I held a presentation about American Christmas traditions as I knew them. &nbsp;At that point I was the only exchange student in our local group who could converse well enough for a large group to really understand.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That is about the same time I started dreaming in German. &nbsp;Mostly it was unintelligible, but I knew it was German and NOT English. &nbsp;It seems that I&rsquo;m slowly getting there with programming. &nbsp;By that I mean, I start to fall asleep and I can think about is how to make additions to my game, how to make what I want to have happen. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m starting to &lsquo;daydream&rsquo; about programming, and the passion&rsquo;s hit me hard.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I hear it&rsquo;s a common malady for many programmers. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the constant feedback you get from making a change and being able to immediately see it on the screen. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s painfully addictive. &nbsp;I remember the first few times I was able to program something on my own and make it work. &nbsp;It made me giddy in a very silly way (and I&rsquo;m already quite silly, so it soon digressed in to beaker-like squeals). &nbsp;Yet I still have other demands on my time, things that must be done. &nbsp;How am I to find time to satisfy my urges? &nbsp;What happens if my urges don&rsquo;t pay the bills (this the most horrifying of questions)? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Another day draws to a close and I want to go find a late night coffee shop and order a white mocha and get started on additions to my game. &nbsp;But I have to keep a schedule, and besides I&rsquo;m already tired. &nbsp;Plus the cats just won&rsquo;t shut up. &nbsp;Time for bed.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: Interesting notes about programming humor</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span></div>
