I've been wanting to for over a year now, however the first one I found a year ago, asked only for participants whose experience had been over a year prior.  Anyways, it finally happened.  Paperwork is in, and I'm crossing my fingers that I get to help out.

However even seeing the word **bullying** or **bully** is now a trigger.  I could feel the anxiety in me rise as I started to read some of the pdfs they sent me.  I know I can have a tendency to worry too much, and react to peoples reactions as if they are acting passive-agressive even if they aren't.  My experience was not just because of me...I was blamed for something I could prove wasn't my fault and no one bothered to do anything to show they even believed me.

Reading over some of the sample interview questions I was reminded of some recent information I found out.  My prior superior was recently promoted into a position that has no subordinates.  That partially makes me feel better, except that she still got a pay raise.  I know that's how things work, it still angers me dangerously.  Why promote someone who isn't doing their job?

You know what I asked for from the whole investigation?  An apology from my superior for her behavior and to be taken off of probation.  That was it.  Considering I had proved I was not at fault for the occurance that put me there in the first place, I didn't understand how difficult that was to ask for.  I remember HR telling me, we don't feel we should ask her to apologize for something we can't prove happened.
  
Basically I was expendable.  It's true, that position was something they could have easily filled.  It still doesn't make it right that they allowed it to happen in the first place.  I think, more than anything, I just want her to admit that it happened.
