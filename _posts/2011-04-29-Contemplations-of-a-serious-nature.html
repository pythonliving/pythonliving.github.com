<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7239850817713886" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Some days I can look outside a coffee shop window, and see dreary grey staring me down. &nbsp;It tells me my hair&rsquo;s too flat, and my belly too big. &nbsp;The caffeine talks to me. &nbsp;It says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as strong as I used to be, am I?&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Vitamin D I take floods my system like a placebo, thus I sit lacking the needed side-effect and stare back at the grey skies. &nbsp;Fantastic Indie music rains down from the ceiling, increasing the glumness of an Oregon April afternoon. &nbsp;What is it about indie music that increases my depression some days. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Did I mention that I stayed up last night crying?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I stayed up all night thinking about escape. &nbsp;Then I started thinking about suicide, and it started to freak me out. &nbsp;Over and over again in my head I would think about packing up my backpack and going boxcar hopping. &nbsp;That or simply disappearing into the local hills coming down only to get food once in a while. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Have I explained that I&rsquo;m suffering from depression? &nbsp;Well, yes, in one of my previous entries I mentioned it, and then wrote this little article about how to keep it from making me productive. &nbsp;But then yesterday I thought, what do I really want to do with myself that I think will make me happy. &nbsp;What am I passionate about? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What am I passionate about anyways?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;What can I do that anyone else can&rsquo;t do better. &nbsp;All anyone writes about is how it doesn&rsquo;t matter what others do, and if it&rsquo;s been done before, because you still need to create. &nbsp;When my ego shrinks and my feelings become minute imaging anything positive is difficult. &nbsp;Thinking that my creations make a difference is so incredibly difficult that I curl into a ball and start to bawl.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I am not writing this because I want my friends or family to call me frantically. &nbsp;I am writing this to show that I contemplated escape. &nbsp;That such contemplations lead me to thinking about suicide, which is why I ended up on some suicide prevention websites. &nbsp;Perhaps if more people were willing to talk about contemplating escape or suicide, then such contemplations would be less unacceptable socially to discuss. &nbsp;Then more people would seek help instead of being afraid to even mention it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve had several friends attempt suicide. &nbsp;They are good friends, and luckily they have all survived. &nbsp;If I don&rsquo;t talk about this, and be open about it, then I will only sink further into my own internal grief. &nbsp;</span></div>
