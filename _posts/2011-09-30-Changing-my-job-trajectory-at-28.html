<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I chose to give up a stable income. &nbsp;I chose to give up what was known, what was easy. &nbsp;I chose to begin a path that would allow me to create my own future. &nbsp;Albeit, hacking down the bushes in a jungle to start your path is a rough way to start, but sometimes you have no choice. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></div>
