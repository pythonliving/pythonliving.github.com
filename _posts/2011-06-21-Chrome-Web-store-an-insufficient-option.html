<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4822116366121918" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Google&rsquo;s Chrome Web Store is great. &nbsp;It allows for a more public viewing of HTML5 and Flash games. &nbsp;It creates a hub for those games, and it allows for an interested person to go and find, well, something via Google. &nbsp;The name of the game, really. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One would think this means that the Web Store is providing an outlet for independent developers. &nbsp;But it doesn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t allow for a serious search of all the games on their site. &nbsp;You have to use their search engine, there is no other way around it. &nbsp;This leads to no one learning about the game because they&rsquo;re browsing the puzzle section, as there is no brain and puzzle section beyond the main page. &nbsp;They only learn about it if they actually search for our games name, or they view the small featured and popular section. &nbsp;This allows for little to no visibility for smaller game developers. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It also has no real rubric for counting how the weekly installs or total users are collected. &nbsp;We have no idea how those numbers are made. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve watched our own numbers, and I think the names (&lsquo;users&rsquo; and &lsquo;weekly installs&rsquo;) are incredibly misleading. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really quite too bad, because I used to think that the Chrome Web Store was a great option for our games. &nbsp;Now I&rsquo;m wondering, especially due to the lack of ability to browse, if it&rsquo;s even worth our time. &nbsp;</span></div>
