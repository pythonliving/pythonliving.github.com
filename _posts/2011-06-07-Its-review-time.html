<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.08425854821689427" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Today we sent out for reviews of our product, Curvy. &nbsp;Now that High Scores are available I felt it was high time we had some people with the experience of reviewing take a look at it. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Both of us are nervous and yet work/life must go on. &nbsp;More work to do, more products to create, more funding to find... such is the crux of our situation. &nbsp;Financing a start up until you actually have enough stuff out there is a bit difficult. &nbsp;They want to take collateral out on your existing products but we have only a few at the moment.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On a side note I&rsquo;m doing rather well mentally right now. &nbsp;Robey has enacted a strict &ldquo;No TV unless it&rsquo;s MIT&rdquo; policy (outside of our Harry Potter review for the upcoming release). &nbsp;I can read pleasure books if I want and it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m doing. &nbsp;I found that not watching TV *amazingly* has made me much more productive. &nbsp;Seriously, the things you know and yet don&rsquo;t do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s crazy how often that happens. &nbsp;</span></div>
