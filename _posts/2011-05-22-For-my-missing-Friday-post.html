<p>Many apologies about Friday. &nbsp;I had been having an okay week, but learned on Friday that my unemployment was denied. &nbsp;I'll be posting more of a response soon to come, but I wanted to make sure you all knew that I'm still here, just having a rough time of deciding whether or not I want to contest the decision.</p>
<p>How much is too much? &nbsp;And how do you know when to stop?</p>
<p>So, in order to allow myself time and space, I've been trying to do a lot of reading to help myself recover. &nbsp;I just finished the new Jean Auel book, and I've already finished season 3 of Saving Grace.</p>
<p>Back to work tomorrow morning.</p>
