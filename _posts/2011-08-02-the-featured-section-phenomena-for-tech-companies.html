<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6201022414024919" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What does being part of a &ldquo;featured&rdquo; section mean? &nbsp;By a &ldquo;featured&rdquo; section I&rsquo;m talking about those sections that are supported by most big markets. &nbsp;Amazon, Chrome Marketplace, Android Market, and so on. &nbsp;Even Kickstarter is a culprit. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s quite sad that so many of these websites provide a &ldquo;featured&rdquo; section, and thereby tend to be known for supporting startups or independent application developers. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sad because the overwhelming evidence shows it&rsquo;s simply not true. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you look at so many of these sites you&rsquo;ll see that a majority of their &ldquo;feature&rdquo; applications are actually from big-name companies. &nbsp;So if you&rsquo;re a big-name company it works out, you&rsquo;ve got the in. &nbsp;Another aspect is that they simply won&rsquo;t feature you unless you having something that has lots of bling and flashy lights. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To understand more why I say this, simply view the Kickstarter page describing a &ldquo;featured&rdquo; project. &nbsp;They indicate you need not only a good following but also an intriguing video and creative idea for your project. &nbsp;All these caveats, in fact, still simply indicate that to be featured, means to be hand chosen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Alright, I know I&rsquo;m complaining here, but this is honestly frustrating. &nbsp;We aren&rsquo;t unwilling to put the effort in but half of this featured action is all about who you know. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re in small town Corvallis, we don&rsquo;t know many people. &nbsp;With over 6,000 facebook likes, I feel like our products aren&rsquo;t something to shirk at. &nbsp;Then more of the frustration is simply because it doesn&rsquo;t feel like these big-name companies want to help the startup. &nbsp;They need to keep their money floating and producing, so they don&rsquo;t bother truly supporting those who can come up some of the startling &nbsp;innovations out there. &nbsp;Now dies my admiration of big tech companies, and in its place is, &ldquo;Oh yeah, they&rsquo;re just another big company...they act like all the others do.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Therefore when you have other underhanded things, like the app-of-the-day Amazon treatment, you&rsquo;re not as surprised. &nbsp;In case you&rsquo;re unaware, it seems that most people who become app-of-the-day for Amazon are asked to sign a last minute agreement that states they actually won&rsquo;t get any money for their app, and they must actually give it away for free if they want to be app-of-the-day at all. &nbsp;So, unless you&rsquo;re already popular enough that you can &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo;, you actually don&rsquo;t get anything from app-of-the-day except one large free give-away. &nbsp;You get promotion, but no actual money. &nbsp;Since you&rsquo;re giving away you&rsquo;re paid version, how much does this really help you? &nbsp;So wait, how does that help the fledgling developers? &nbsp;How do these supposed &ldquo;Tech Giants&rdquo; actually support startup gaming companies again? &nbsp;I understand these &ldquo;featured&rdquo; sections are actually to support the their own market. &nbsp;I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t be so upset if these big companies were just honest and stopped claiming to be support the small developer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
