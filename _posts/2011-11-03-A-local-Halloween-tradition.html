<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Unlike most Halloween years, fraught with parties and candy, I didn&rsquo;t do much this year. &nbsp;The only thing I really did was get together with a friend from college and go to a corn maze. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been a yearly tradition for about 4 or 5 years now, and it&rsquo;s one of the few activities we can both make time for. &nbsp;For the past two years I&rsquo;ve been bringing my nephew, Alex, who is starting 6th grade. &nbsp;Last year was his first, and it was only myself, him, and my friend from Eugene. &nbsp;This past year it was a group of us, three from the Eugene area and five from our area. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Each year we&rsquo;ll get coffee or chai on the drive down. &nbsp;It takes about 45 minutes to get there, and I take the second turn instead of the first like I should. &nbsp;It would take 30 minutes, but as I only go to this location once every year, remembering which turn is the wrong one is a bit more of a challenge. &nbsp;We still make it, it just takes a bit longer than it should. &nbsp;As I always leave too early, however, so it always works out. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Did I mention yet that I also got to experience a car full of boys this time on the ride down? &nbsp;A full car meant two adult men, and two 6th grade boys plus me. &nbsp;That was definitely an interesting experience, considering I was driving and mainly listened to conversation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Anyways, wandering through a corn maze is a fairly common Halloween tradition here in Oregon. &nbsp;Whether it&rsquo;s haunted or not is the main factor of importance. &nbsp;There are day versions of the maze, and then darkness-strewn horrors for those with more interested in getting the &lsquo;be-jesus&rsquo; scared out of them. &nbsp;We prefer the later. &nbsp;The corn maze we visit each year is quite amazing because it is accompanied by people with chainsaws that chase after you, and a bus full of convicts/zombies that you must walk through. &nbsp;My least favorite item is a small section you must walk through, where there are bags of cloth that are filled with air which only provide a small area that you have to push your way through. &nbsp;I have some problems with claustrophobia, and so am very much not a fan of that section of the maze. &nbsp;There are also many, many people in masks that lurk behind corners waiting for you to look the other way. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There is something to say about the way the moon will light up the tips of the corn stalks as you walk down the long paths of the maze. &nbsp;The wisps of stalks chatter amongst themselves, for they know where the frighteners lurk. &nbsp;The slight chill and dampness of the air makes the hair on the back of your neck prickle. &nbsp;There is a light crunch to the dampened straw underneath your feet, which increases your heightened awareness. &nbsp;Around that corner could simply be another path, just another path surely...</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once out of the maze we&rsquo;ll drink warm cider and eat kettle corn for a bit, then slowly wander back to our cars. &nbsp;Driving through the night on the way home can be somewhat tiring, but that&rsquo;s why I had Robey do it this year. &nbsp;Less work for me, and more time joking around with my nephew in the back seat. &nbsp;Especially when this included me doing my utmost to gross him out by sticking glow sticks in my nose. &nbsp;I really am going to embarrass the **** out of him when he gets older. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t wait..</span></div>
