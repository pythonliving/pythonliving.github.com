<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.014634792925789952" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve reviewed Lectures 1 and 2 of the Intro to Computer Science MIT OCW (Open Course Ware) course, and that went well. &nbsp;It especially made more sense after doing the readings, and helped to enforce the information. &nbsp;I would highly suggest it. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I would also highly suggest to NOT do the readings before watching the lectures they are about. &nbsp;I tried to get through a bunch of the readings, to make sure I was caught up, and then read a bit ahead so I had more of an idea of what I was going into during Lecture 3.. &nbsp;Which, it feels like Lectures 1-3 readings are not organized correctly considering what he&rsquo;s talking about in the lectures. &nbsp;This could also be attributed to my lack of understanding in the materials, as this is my first time through a programming language.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Anyways, this compounded the issue, as I was trying to do the readings along with the lectures, and then a bit extra. &nbsp;Since they seemed to be disorganized I ended up reading more ahead than I had wished for, and then getting even more confused when I tried to do one of the suggested exercises in the readings and just sat there with my head in my hands totally confused. &nbsp;Finally I decided that I would go back and just try watching lecture 3 leisurely so that I could just try to get a sense as to what he was talking about. &nbsp;Hoping that the lecture would stave off my confusion. &nbsp;It has helped. &nbsp;However as I need to learn this information and be able to implement and use it, I get the feeling that I will be reviewing some of these lectures, and re-reading the assigned texts until my eyes start to crust over. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I know that this lecture series is 24 episodes long (a semester), and I know that it will be a bit before I can feel a bit more confident about taking random stabs at creating some code. &nbsp;At this point all I can do is feel like I&rsquo;m scratching at the bit (ah my ridiculous mixed metaphors), but know that I really don&rsquo;t have enough footing to even take off. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Well, back to more lecture review. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
