<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7738939158152789" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Often I get this startling homesickness for a place, that honestly, is not my home anymore. &nbsp;It was for so long, and much of my family is still down there. &nbsp;Pine Hill, Alabama or Avinger, Texas, both pull at my heart strings. &nbsp;Small southern towns of 3000 and less, where you can almost walk anywhere you want in the local area. &nbsp;Places where to actually go shopping you have to drive at least 10 to 20 minutes to get to an actual grocery store. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Places where swimming and humidity were common occurrences. &nbsp;Where life ran slow, and roads were red. &nbsp;Where fireflies and sounds of bullfrogs wandered the night air. &nbsp;A place where I could eat grits, hush puppies, and boiled peanuts in silence. &nbsp;Where armadillos were not uncommon, but the cold northwestern rain forest was.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Where I could smoke a cigarette (if I smoked), on my front porch, and where the only fancy coffee really was the black coffee you made at home. &nbsp;Sometimes life seems so overwhelmingly complicated, with all of the choices that are available. &nbsp;Choices of what to do with your life, or choices of what to eat (all the different options), or choices of what to do in your free time. &nbsp;Granted, I know that by having those freedoms so readily available I&rsquo;m not fully realizing how much they really make a difference in my life. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I was in Florida last year, I learned how difficult it was to get a fancy coffee in the South. &nbsp;It was partially annoying, being that I was in Orlando (aka big city) and I couldn&rsquo;t find a latte unless I drove at least 5-7 minutes to the nearest Starbucks (the only fancy coffee shop around really). &nbsp;Being a resident of Corvallis, Oregon, where I can walk 5 minutes and get a fancy coffee from a local shop, in three different directions from where I live, having that freedom makes me realize Corvallis satisfies a hunger that I can&rsquo;t truly explain. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Despite all I miss the humidity, the red earth, and the drenching rain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
