<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lately I&rsquo;ve been kind of caught up reading a ton of my favorite books from when I was younger. &nbsp;Staying up til 3 or 4 in the morning sometimes, simply to continue reading. &nbsp;The next day I keep going, mentally and physically, I&rsquo;m somewhat tired, but the passion about reading isn&rsquo;t going away. &nbsp;If anything...it feels like it&rsquo;s becoming a problem.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I used to have this problem during high school and college as well. &nbsp;By this problem I mean, I would hide books I was reading in other things, or read them during class because I would finish my homework. &nbsp;That kind of thing. &nbsp;Now, if I&rsquo;m not watching a TV series in succession I&rsquo;m reading a book series, enthralled by the storyline. &nbsp;Am I escaping, am I retreating into imaginary worlds to live? &nbsp;What is it that these books that I crave so much?</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s amazing how when we&rsquo;re younger our parents kept emphasizing that books were great for us, because they stimulated creativity and passion. &nbsp;Getting obsessed with books was a wonderful thing. &nbsp;Slowly as you got older, it wasn&rsquo;t as cool anymore. &nbsp;Finally now I feel they play the same role that many TV shows are trying to play. &nbsp;They are story lines that suck you in. &nbsp;Now they are simply distractions and not accepted as building blocks. &nbsp;As an adult you are expected to simply consume and produce. &nbsp;You are supposed to support the economy in whatever way you most appreciate. &nbsp;Find a way to support society, while still having &lsquo;fun&rsquo;.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Why is it, then, that I get so book obsessive? &nbsp;Why is it that sometimes I can&rsquo;t set my story down? &nbsp;Because unlike many things, this one has an end. &nbsp;There is an end to this book, and you will get to it. &nbsp;You will be able to satisfy your curiosity about these characters, and learn what makes them tick. &nbsp;I guess the way to make your real life more interesting is to find a way to feel the same about the things you&rsquo;re working on. &nbsp;Find a way to see an end, even if temporary. &nbsp;Find a way to have small steps, things that show accomplishment. &nbsp;Find a way to receive satisfaction. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Small Goals, it&rsquo;s all about the small goal (even if it means memorizing 5 new things about what you&rsquo;re working on, hey that&rsquo;s 5 new things you know).</span></div>
