 This upcoming Wednesday I will be going on a trip around Oregon with my mother and nephew.  The hope is to see parts of Southeastern Oregon that most people never visit.  I spent a good half of Sunday planning the trip.

 I haven't been able to program lately.  I spent the end of last week and today (and soon to be tomorrow) translating.  I would love to work on it, but after 8 hours of translation each day I'm rather worn out.  I'll post information and details about where I traveled once I return.

 I've finally started running again after I sprained my ankle about a month ago.  It's very slow going.  I don't think I realized just how fast I was running back then, because right now I feel like a snail.  

 Anyways, it's time I should be heading to bed.  It's been a long day, and tomorrow will be even longer.
