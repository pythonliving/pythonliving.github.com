<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6286250022239983" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There are days, some serious days, when I simply wish this was a private diary where I could simply rant about everything. &nbsp;Days when I wish this was a blog where even if I simply ranted there would be plenty of people who commented, or days when if I didn&rsquo;t want comments and none were given. &nbsp;Days when I didn&rsquo;t have to care about whom I wrote about, and whether or not they would read it. &nbsp;Days when I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about someone else getting hurt by what I said. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There are times when I wish I could give more, give more and provide more for my family and friends. &nbsp;Times when I wish I could be that pillar, that one person who might change the lives of my nieces and nephews drastically. &nbsp;Times when I wish I could do a million things and then I get worried about all of these millions of things and am unable to actually get anything done. &nbsp;I end up too stressed out and drained like a keg after a frat party. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes I feel like there are simply so many things to be doing and accomplishing that I freak out, and my momentum stops before I even get started. &nbsp;All these ideas are boiling around in my head but getting them out is just taking time from something else I could be doing. &nbsp;Something else that is equally important. &nbsp;I need to learn more programming, then I realize I could be spending my time teaching my niece soccer. &nbsp;Or I feel I need exercise more and realize I could equally be cleaning up the house. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What I don&rsquo;t understand is boredom. &nbsp;I used to understand boredom when I was much younger. &nbsp;When I would stay in Texas for the summer with my father in this 500 person podunk town, with no friends or family, and one room with air conditioning. &nbsp;A summer where all I did was watch TV or read books and hang out with my dad. &nbsp;Boredom is now a luxury. &nbsp;One that only occurs when my body, mind, and heart are done for the day and cannot do much else. &nbsp;Although lately even that isn&rsquo;t occurring. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading books, and learning about things until I start to pass out. &nbsp;Then I wake up and get going again. &nbsp;Something about the Fall makes me more capable, more productive. &nbsp;It reminds me of starting school, and the excitement of it all. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Do the seasons heavily affect your productivity? &nbsp;Another, more important question, is how can we expect them not to?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
