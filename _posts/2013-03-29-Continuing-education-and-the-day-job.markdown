I've been coding almost everyday for almost a month.  It feels great learning to code again after such a long break.  I've been messing around with several different tracks on Codecademy: the newly established *php*, *jQuery* and hoping to finish the final *javascript* section soon.  The *jQuery* section is fantastic; I'm already learning new tools to use on my own website!

Robey and I have also been getting our garden together.  We're growing quite a bit this year: tomatoes, potatoes, peas, lettuce, kale, swiss chard, garlic, shallots, turnips, kohlrabi, cucumbers, radishes, and hoping for some eggplant, peppers and beans.  Thanks to our new community garden plot, our total space has increased 33%.

I'm still fairly busy at work, but it's slowing down a bit just in time for translations (Chemistry batch records German to English) to begin again.  Just when I thought I might have a bit of brain power to do website work in the evenings!  Ah well, I really should take a day off sometime in April so I can just work on my blog or my game.  Unfortunately April is the month for planting, which means it would probably turn into a garden day anyways.

I'm also starting my first day of basic riding training today.  This means that by the end of the weekend I may be certified to ride a motorcycle!  Just another oddity to add to my list of capabilities.  

On my current list of weekly activities - indoor soccer (normally 2 days a week), rock climbing (2 to 3 days a week), I spend one afternoon playing Halo with a good friend, working in the garden when I have energy/time, crochet (currently working on a throw blanket for the living room), and then hanging out with friends and of course...spending time with Robey.  Life is busy!!
