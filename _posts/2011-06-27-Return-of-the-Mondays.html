<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7407911149784923" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sorry I was out Friday, and missed posting an entry. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been a long, long weekend. &nbsp;It was one of those weekends where you want and attempt to get thousands of things done, get hundreds done, and see the subsequent leftovers in guilt. &nbsp;That on top of other aspects and pains in my life has me at a ridiculous standstill today. &nbsp;I simply cannot find any motivation.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This is exacerbated by the fact that I need to get on the triangle of learning (like being on the ball but traditionally more difficult and with less options). &nbsp;Without more learning I continue down the path of unable and non-programmer. &nbsp;Without it our business continues at the pace of one fast programmer without a buddy to decode his stuffs. &nbsp;</span><br /><br />
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 49.5pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Totally random thought; one thing I truly dislike is the fact that so many bloggers out there make money off of people looking for solutions, when the solutions are already inside of them. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t need bloggers to tell them what to do. &nbsp;Sure, they can get ideas, but there are so many useless bloggers out there.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 49.5pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I know that last little set of comments isn&rsquo;t going to make me any friends out there, but honestly. &nbsp;For those who blog or read a lot of blogs, is it not quite crazy how many of them write about stuff you really don&rsquo;t care about? &nbsp;Things that are so cliche, marketed, and annoying? &nbsp;Someone told me once that the idea is to stay focused on being unique. &nbsp;Be yourself, because you&rsquo;re unique. &nbsp;Learn from your own uniqueness and others will soon enjoy it as well. &nbsp;Do you really need to say the things people understand, or is it more profitable to continue to be &lsquo;that weird guy/gal.&rsquo;</span></p>
<br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Back to the former topic. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m still having troubles finding motivation despite that this past month has been our most profitable yet. &nbsp;I think the thing that freaks me out a bit is that I&rsquo;ve already sent out Press Hooks to a variety and non-small list of places to get it reviewed and we&rsquo;ve only been really noticed by the UK. &nbsp;How often can you send notices to Newspapers and other such review sites without driving them crazy? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Back to finding motivation. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve requested that motivation come back and join me for some more regular work hours. &nbsp;I need you to hang out this time, not visit for a free beer and then skedaddle. &nbsp;Motivation should come and replace my current house guest, depression. &nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s back and in full force. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s included in it&rsquo;s arsenal some hate filled sayings, cruel words, and a deep hankering for cheese and chocolate. &nbsp;You might throw dill pickles in that mix as well.</span><br /><br />
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So what do I need?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
