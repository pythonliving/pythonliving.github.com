<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When you are teaching yourself to do something, without much structured help, it can make learning sometimes difficult. &nbsp;However, the cool thing about starting to get good at something is when you see it start to come together. &nbsp;Like with crocheting, or other such material endeavours, it can be fairly obvious where your abilities lay. &nbsp;In the beginning...well....it can look really crappy.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For example:</span></div>

<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When you&rsquo;re learning to program you can be disorganized and leave lots of holes in your code. &nbsp;My crochet projects were just as riddled with empty spots and incomplete rows as my first pieces of code were. &nbsp;Then, after time (a period of two years), I learned to crochet complete lines, with even spacing, and they looked much better.</span></div>
