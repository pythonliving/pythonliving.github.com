<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.004253301303833723" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For the first time in quite a while I felt like showing off something to some close friends. &nbsp;Something I had done that was work related. &nbsp;I was showing off the website. &nbsp;At first I was simply excited, wanting to share my happiness and pride in my work. &nbsp;However I could tell right away, once I let my friends see, that I was still feeling the grip of nervousness from my previous position. &nbsp;I felt right away that whatever I was doing was expected of my position, that there was nothing in particular that was exciting about it. &nbsp;Even then, that the updates I had produced for the website were not of any value, and simply looked out dated. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m so angry that I still feel this way. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That I can be happy like a child having built a sand castle, wanting to show it off, and even though my friends react and are interested in what I did, I </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">assume</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> that they aren&rsquo;t impressed or even intrigued by it. &nbsp;I automatically assume that I&rsquo;m less than ordinary, and that I&rsquo;m wasting other&rsquo;s time. &nbsp;Acceptance is a powerful thing. &nbsp;Learning acceptance of oneself, but also learning acceptance of what can be. &nbsp;That you can imagine yourself to be grand and amazing, and that it is so. &nbsp;That you can make self employment work, in a world surrounded by racing rats on a NASCAR turnpike. &nbsp;Nothing is ordinary, it&rsquo;s all extraordinary and vivid. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I see my friends around me, and I see and hear the wanting. &nbsp;The wish for a more flexible lifestyle, one that didn&rsquo;t rely on face to face interactions, on people they didn&rsquo;t know, but on your abilities and work ethic. &nbsp;The wish that so many in my generation want fulfilled. &nbsp;To feel like hard work can pay off. &nbsp;To not feel harassed by others, and to feel that others trust that you are doing your best. &nbsp;I find this so humorous, because I&rsquo;ve always been able to get a lot done in a short amount of time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always been a great worker in all previous jobs, but in my most recent one I had serious issues feeling any kind of fulfillment. &nbsp;I would work hard, and do my best and then feel great about my work, and then still be made to feel horrid by the end of the day. &nbsp;This, of course, culminating, in being told later that I was simply imagining the whole thing. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not crazy. &nbsp;I question myself too much to begin with. &nbsp;I was willing to work with them on some things. &nbsp;On others it just started to pile up. &nbsp;I was told by a variety of people that they appreciated me, and appreciated my work. &nbsp;My ability to respond to emails and get things done. &nbsp;I would do my best to get things done as best as I could, but I understood that depending on what the ultimate goal was, quality or timeliness, could vary. &nbsp;I did my best to adjust to that needed demand. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Is normal work life simply going to work 8 to 5, getting harped on whenever you&rsquo;re even a minute late? &nbsp;Even though you&rsquo;re willing to stay late every day to get more work done. &nbsp;Wishing that you could just stay later some nights when you&rsquo;re getting lots done. &nbsp;Instead you&rsquo;re told that you can&rsquo;t have that flexibility. &nbsp;Then you&rsquo;re asked to not attend any meetings, even when requested by others. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I want to be successful, and I want to feel like I can tell my old boss off. &nbsp;I need her to know that I&rsquo;m effective and powerful, and that she can&rsquo;t put me down anymore. &nbsp;But you know, why do I need someone&rsquo;s approval, especially if that someone made me feel so horrid in the first place? &nbsp;Why do I even care what she thinks? &nbsp;Like all others, I try to use what other people think to help verify my baseline identity. &nbsp;If I get notifications that I&rsquo;m late all the time and that I continuously make mistakes, then I start to self-identify as a delinquent employee, despite whether or not that&rsquo;s true. &nbsp;What if I simply want to be an employee with flexibly to my work schedule because I&rsquo;m willing to work late? &nbsp;The worst part of it all is my fear of how those who read this now will react, and how this will affect what they think of me. &nbsp;As I state that I was told I was late, do they believe me, or do they judge me as she did? &nbsp;Do they assume or interpret?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So many questions....all answers are simply acceptance of self. &nbsp;I am who I am. &nbsp;I cannot deny, but I can always work to improve myself towards whatever ideal I am currently heading towards. &nbsp;I am working on so much right now that all I can think about is that I try to get my body back in line, get the homeless connect event off without a hitch, and get this business pulling in the dough. &nbsp;That way Robey and I can stay where we are and be happy. &nbsp;We can start to pay off bills and other such things, pay rent, and buy things we want. &nbsp;We can do things around the house, and I can read books or go to coffee, and have a life with my friends and family.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A lot of hard work will be needed to get that to happen. &nbsp;I think it can be done. &nbsp;I hope others have faith as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
