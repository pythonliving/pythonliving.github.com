<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My game is now complete, in it&rsquo;s initial phase! &nbsp;Woo programming excitement! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m super excited to share my recent creation (with much help from Robey), called </span><a href="http://flaminglunchbox.net/towerpower"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Science Fiction Tower Power</span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> (for now). &nbsp;I hope people enjoy it, and make sure to let me know of any bugs/problems they find as they check it out.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before the game was originally meant to provide my nieces and nephews a more entertaining way to practice basic math skills. &nbsp;Game creation was especially prompted when I learned how memorization of simple addition/subtraction/multiplication is no longer required in the local schools. &nbsp;My nephew is always provided a calculator and a multiplication table for all of his math tests. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s in 6th grade. &nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t this seem wrong? &nbsp;At least it does to me. &nbsp;I remember memorizing the combinations during elementary school and I feel it&rsquo;s made my life much easier in the long run. &nbsp;Heck I&rsquo;m even excited to try this game out so that I can work on them again, because I&rsquo;m not as quick as I used to be. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We originally meant this to be a weekend project when it was going to be mostly programmed by Robey, but we quickly decided to shove some javascript into my brain by making this little exercise mine. &nbsp;Thus a weekend project turned into a week project (let&rsquo;s be honest, week and a half), mainly produced by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/?iid=am-27825118013225146929337528&amp;nid=22+dm_sender_profile&amp;uid=259906848&amp;utm_content=profile#!/pythonliving"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">pythonliving</span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m excited to continue to develop my project, and if you have any suggestions I would love to hear them. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve mentioned some updates I want to make in a previous entry, but here are a couple just to wet your Holiday taste-buds with:</span><br />
