<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8900560603942722" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Currently I&rsquo;m spending a ton of time working on a Cribbage Rules Tutorial. &nbsp;Explaining the rules to this game is more difficult than I expected. &nbsp;This is mainly because I&rsquo;m hoping to create a tutorial that is so gosh darn amazing that I can send it all over the Internet and get us a lot of exposure among the Cribbage sites. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m using Wink which, thanks to </span><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/philshapiro"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Phil Shapiro</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, I learned is a </span><a href="http://slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=noble+piece+prize"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Noble Piece Prize</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> winner, &nbsp;not to be confused with the Nobel Peace Prize. This little program does pretty much the same things as Adobe Captivate but is Open Source. &nbsp;Open is also known as adjustable, code available and in this case free. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going well, this Cribbage Rules tutorial creation. &nbsp;It is, however, one of the more onerous of my tasks and has thus filled up more of my time than expected. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m making sure to take breaks so that I can devote true focus to this project. &nbsp;Honestly, there are loads of people out there who don&rsquo;t know how to play Cribbage. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s just shameful! &nbsp;Not to mention harmful for the business. &nbsp;I must encourage the learning of this splendid game. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I find it saddening that the game doesn&rsquo;t really exist outside of the English speaking world. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s considered mainly an English (aka English speaking, however originating from England) game. &nbsp;Perhaps we can find a way to cultivate this game in other cultures and find a way to bring about world peace through online game play! &nbsp;Anyone up for translating a tutorial into their native language? &nbsp;I can translate it mainly into Deutsch, but I&rsquo;m so rusty I would need someone to heavily double check my grammar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br /></div>
