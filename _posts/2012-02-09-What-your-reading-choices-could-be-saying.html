<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.3695310293696821"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I had a thought the other day, and I&rsquo;m sure many have thought of this before. &nbsp;Why is it that sometimes certain books call out to you more than others? &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How do we choose the books that we read?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Lately I&rsquo;ve been seriously consuming fantasy novels. &nbsp;This is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to move away from simply watching TV shows all the time. &nbsp;I still crochet half the time while watching TV, but I watch nonetheless. &nbsp;I was starting to feel...well.....boring.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So to quiet this feeling I decided to move on to books, and boy have I. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve read almost 10 books in the past three to four weeks. &nbsp;Granted, that means I&rsquo;ve been doing little else. &nbsp;The house is clean, I&rsquo;ve been crocheting every once in a while, running, playing soccer and work, but once that is all done I start reading. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Anyways, back to the thought I had. &nbsp;I realized that </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">try as I might to read books that quote &ldquo;Make me classier&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Read books that teach me vocabulary that will help with the GRE&rdquo; I just couldn't. &nbsp;They were too stressful. </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Robey and I love what were doing, but we definitely aren&rsquo;t making a whole lot of money, thus we have high money stresses. &nbsp;What else? &nbsp;Other normal life stresses can always play a role like not having health insurance. &nbsp;Also having student loan &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; starting their phone overtures begging to empty our bank accounts. &nbsp;All of this adds up. &nbsp;Once complete we&rsquo;re both a jumble of nerves. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So my thought; how stressful you&rsquo;re life is can heavily effect your reading choices. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Why do I choose fantasy?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;It&rsquo;s true that some fantasy can be heavy reading. &nbsp;Some is quite involved and littered with intense vocabulary. &nbsp;However it&rsquo;s the focus and the overlying themes that really gets me sucked in. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So many fantasy novels start with the person who has no idea how special they are. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The person that finds out there is something amazing about them.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Then they train and they work, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">and in about 5-6 hours they often topple kingdoms.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They change their entire lives. </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Often they start at the bottom of the chain and move to becoming someone that matters. &nbsp;A person who might have had issues in the beginning, but one who slowly and rather easily overcomes them.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So many of the more intense books (especially ones including the main character going through serious self reflection), are ones I have difficulty getting into. &nbsp;I am going through enough self reflection on my own. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I need the books I read to show me hope.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;I need them to show me that hard work pays off.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;One that shows a seemingly simple person beating the odds and becoming something powerful. &nbsp;One that, even with some people dying and lots of fighting, can show that change is possible. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I guess what bugs me about this realization is that </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">many people judge you on the type of books you read</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;If you read the more intense and self-reflective books, you&rsquo;re probably more often judged to be a &lsquo;classy reader&rsquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Being a &lsquo;classy reader&rsquo; in many ways can also be a judgement of a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;station&rsquo; or &lsquo;class.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This reminds me of </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">something my Uncle Gene once said, &ldquo;Keeping your mind active is more important than the type of books you read.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;That&rsquo;s an approximate quote because we were all busily munching away on oysters or something at the time and I don&rsquo;t remember much else. &nbsp;But the point is this; The kind of books you chose doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s simply important that you keep reading.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Understanding what you choose is important because it can help you to realize why you&rsquo;re choosing the books you do. &nbsp;If the books you chose are making you happy and content, then they are serving their purpose. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Don&rsquo;t change because you think you&rsquo;re not reading something &lsquo;mentally stimulating&rsquo; enough. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t change because you want people to think higher of you. &nbsp;You pick the books you do for a reason. &nbsp;Let them make you happy.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;
