<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6795751261524856" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What is my generation defined by? &nbsp;By it&rsquo;s tenacity, and it&rsquo;s want for change. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s aided by our confidence, provided by our parents. &nbsp;What does this mean? &nbsp;What problems does it create? &nbsp;A variety, and painful ones at that. &nbsp;Does that mean we can&rsquo;t be successful, or that we complain more than other generations? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My generation (I&rsquo;m 28 I remind you), was brought up to change the world. &nbsp;To save the whales and rainforests, cure AIDS, beat cancer, and establish full fledged equality. &nbsp;To do so we were told to go to college and get a degree, because without one we would be unable to pursue our dreams or get a decent job. &nbsp;Thus we accrued debt like our parents accrued mortgages. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Then we attempted to pursue our dreams, and save the rainforests, or we tried to get the jobs to learn how to cure AIDS. &nbsp;Then we learned that there wasn&rsquo;t enough funding in the world for us all to do that, so some of us got other jobs. &nbsp;Jobs to pay the bills, which often resulted in us going into positions we were over educated for. &nbsp;This created a large pool of dissatisfied workers who knew they were smarter than their boss, or more capable. &nbsp;Many times they were even told by their superiors that they knew they were smarter than them.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Many didn&rsquo;t get jobs at all. &nbsp;They then moved back in with their parents who were paying mortgages. &nbsp;These parents started to get nervous. &nbsp;&ldquo;What happens if my child doesn&rsquo;t get a job? &nbsp;Will I have raised a slacker as a kid? &nbsp;Obviously they&rsquo;re not trying hard enough.&rdquo; they think. &nbsp;Then they start to complain about their children at work. &nbsp;Sometimes to the others in my generation who simply got a job to pay the bills. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That leaves even more young people feeling suddenly disillusioned about life. &nbsp;They had been brought up around totally different values and ideas. &nbsp;Now my generation is being shunned by the same people who told them to believe in the world. &nbsp;What our parents were really saying was believe in us. &nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;m here to say we still believe in you. &nbsp;You just can&rsquo;t stop believing in us. &nbsp;We believe in you. &nbsp;We want to make this world a better place. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t choose to stop putting in the effort now. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re here. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re educated, and we want to make a difference. &nbsp;USE US. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let our talents and abilities go to waste. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t assume we don&rsquo;t know about the way the world works. &nbsp;If we don&rsquo;t, talk to us. &nbsp;Explain to us why. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t just stop thinking that since we&rsquo;re young adults it means you no longer have to care about teaching and educating us. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Does this mean we&rsquo;re over-confident? &nbsp;Perhaps we&rsquo;re just confident. &nbsp;Perhaps we haven&rsquo;t lost our passion. &nbsp;Perhaps we were taught that this is the way to make things happen. &nbsp;Look to our educators. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t simply blame us for being over-confident, entitled, and a generation of complainers. &nbsp;We were taught to believe in the world, and to believe in you. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Where would we learn to complain from? &nbsp;Perhaps the Internet, or perhaps our educators and our parents. &nbsp;Where would we learn to feel entitled? &nbsp;From our educators. &nbsp;How could a whole generation have too many people feeling entitled? &nbsp;Where would that come from if an entire generation started doing it? &nbsp;It surely couldn&rsquo;t be genetics, it must from those who raised them. &nbsp;Where would we learn to be confident? &nbsp;From our parents and educators. &nbsp;They taught us to be confident. &nbsp;Is this bad? &nbsp;I would vote no. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To blame us for our failures is blaming a generation for something you helped to create. &nbsp;This means you must take part of the blame, OR you can simply learn the attributes we&rsquo;ve developed and learn to use them and interact with them. &nbsp;You can learn to not discriminate against another generation, a younger generation, simply because they&rsquo;re different. &nbsp;Simply because they don&rsquo;t share the same immediate values that you do. &nbsp;And if we don&rsquo;t share those values, well, that sounds like it&rsquo;s time for us all to have a large family discussion about that fact. &nbsp;Treat us like equals and we&rsquo;ll do the same. &nbsp;I dare you.</span></div>
