<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">
<p id="internal-source-marker_0.9356771891470999" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span> </span></p>
<div style="text-indent: 0px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">I find it hilarious how uncomfortable people get, when I joke about being unemployed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m actually self employed, but I&rsquo;m just not making any money right now. &nbsp;Although honestly aren&rsquo;t they the same thing? &nbsp;It would be nice if it were a more comfortable topic for others, because I&rsquo;m so happy right now. &nbsp;Learning new things, challenging myself, daily working longer hours. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t feel bad and I don&rsquo;t feel irresponsible, it just feels great. &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t felt this good about myself and the work I do for a long time. &nbsp;I can actually choose to work those longer hours, and challenge myself to be better and more amazing at what I do, because it makes a difference and I see it each day. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have to go through tons of people to get it approved. &nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s scary as hell. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m an amazingly talented person either. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve some ability overall, but making this business successful...I want to make it work. &nbsp;I think the dedication here is what makes the difference. &nbsp;The grunt work that I need to work on each day is not nearly as droning, as I know what it gets me. &nbsp;I see the results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I think many people would find that they too have more ability and creativity than they thought, if they had the time to devote to it. &nbsp;That is, if they weren&rsquo;t in jobs that made them unhappy already. &nbsp;That last thought, that honestly may be one of the major reasons why so many people don&rsquo;t wish to talk to me about my unemployment/self employment. &nbsp;They are working jobs that make them unhappy, they don&rsquo;t feel that they can do anything about it. &nbsp;They may be jealous, and wish the same for themselves. &nbsp;Whatever it is, I know I&rsquo;m just speculating. &nbsp;Until I&rsquo;m actually earning enough to pay rent I don&rsquo;t know if I can really say much besides I&rsquo;m enjoying myself. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After thinking about this, I came up with a list of the things about my new position that make me happy. &nbsp;Things that I feel, if employers could provide them to their employees, would make employees feel so much happier at their jobs. &nbsp;</span></p>
<ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Flexibility is provided, because people have a life outside of work</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Trusting that their employees want to get the job done</span></li>

<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">An avid wish to provide professional development opportunities</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">An environment where making mistakes is understood to be part of the learning process</span></li>
</ol></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">All of these things are contigent upon the employer also not doing horrid things.  Such things can include but are not limited to: </span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">
<ul>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lying to their superiors&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Intentionally hiding information&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Blaming miscommunication (or anything really) on their subordinates without due cause</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">That said, I hope that for whatever job comes my way in the future most of the things on the first list will exist while nothing on the second one be present.</span></p>
