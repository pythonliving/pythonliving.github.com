Much of election day was spent refreshing the NPR and New York Times websites for election day results.  I also enjoyed two soccer games last night, which meant I didn't get to do any nail biting as the final results were coming in.  I was, as you can imagine, getting sweaty playing soccer instead.

On election day I did much reflecting.  Thinking about where I wanted the country to go had me thinking about my own personal goals.  Many of these goals have been changing over the past couple of years.  As years have past I am starting to recognize how some goals are plausible and some are simply dreams.  

By dreams I don't mean they're impossible to reach, I simply know that I *want* to do different things in my life now.  I know how much time it takes to accomplish some goals and I realize that some of those I did have conflicted with other higher priorities.  Yesterday, I spent much of my time thinking about what I actually want to accomplish with my life with what I felt like was more possible.  

In learning to program and learning to create websites/HTML5 games I realized that I want to keep creating things.  Mainly, I want to finish my game Science Fiction Tower Power, that I know for sure.  Other than that life has changed enough I've had to go back and start writing up another **Life Goals 2012** list.  

It used to be so easy for me to fill up these lists.  I loved making them.  Now as I work on this one I keep asking myself..."Is that something I **really** want to do?"  I wonder, have I really ever asked myself that before?
