<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">This post is dedicated to my father.</span></p>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">My father became homeless when my mother and him split up during my last term of college. &nbsp;He ended up living in his pickup for two years. &nbsp;He rented a storage facility to keep all his things in, and accessed all the benefits he </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">could to take care of himself. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He also, because of his lack of a fridge and as he was living on food stamps, lost over 90 pounds. &nbsp;He had been severely overweight, but after the lost weight that he feels he could never have done on his own, has felt that this was one of the best things that happened to him in his life. &nbsp;He was able to focus on himself, and take care of himself, and he did. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He also had a membership to a local swimming pool, so he was able to sit in the sauna/hot pools to relax, and keep himself clean. &nbsp;He also started dressing smarter than he ever had. &nbsp;He had always worn mostly sweats and t-shirts. &nbsp;Now he was sifting through the local goodwill and finding nice dress pants, button down shirts, and jackets to wear. &nbsp;He would even wear ties fairly often. &nbsp;Once he started doing all this no one would ever dream to ask if he was homeless. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t look the part. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My father didn&rsquo;t have the money and he honestly didn&rsquo;t know enough about technology to buy a cell phone, so one of the first things I did after I graduated from college was go with him and buy him a phone and put him on my phone plan. &nbsp;That way I could get in touch with him, or him me, if needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
