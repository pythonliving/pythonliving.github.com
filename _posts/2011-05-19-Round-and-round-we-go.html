<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.08764616656117141" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Part of voluntarily leaving a position, and then applying for unemployment, includes explaining why you think you qualify. &nbsp;I left my last position because I felt that after everything that happened, I no longer had an option to stay. &nbsp;I felt that the relationships and my work environment had degraded to a point that my emotional and mental well being were in jeopardy if I remained. &nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I resigned. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been told that if you can prove that you didn&rsquo;t have any other option, then you can qualify for unemployment. &nbsp;So I was interviewed and asked questions to determine if I was eligible. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now, after that conversation, I don&rsquo;t care if I get unemployment anymore. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so sick of having to be reminded of what happened to me. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t care that I started crying while talking to him on the phone. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like the fact that I admitted to him that I&rsquo;m scared of going back to work because I&rsquo;m afraid of being made to feel that way again. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So no, I didn&rsquo;t go seek a counselor or psychologist because of what was going on at work. &nbsp;No, I didn&rsquo;t go and tell someone I didn&rsquo;t approve of their ruling on what happened. &nbsp;No, I didn&rsquo;t try after the initial &ldquo;accusation of harassment&rdquo;, because I felt that it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. &nbsp;I did my best to let them know what was going on, and to state my case. &nbsp;They said there was no evidence to support my claims, therefore I decided it was in my best interest to leave the organization. &nbsp;Even for the people I would have had to work with, that would have been a painful experience. &nbsp;What would you have done? &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I find it so funny, because after going to take my tests and setting up my &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an unemployed person&rsquo; account, one of the workers there who reviewed it said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious you want to work. &nbsp;Normally I don&rsquo;t suggest this but you should make sure to look at the County and City government positions as they come up.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">*Smacks Head*</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On another similar note, it&rsquo;s so great *note extreme sarcasm* that when a person becomes unemployed, when they really might need the help to talk to a counselor, that&rsquo;s exactly when your benefits run out and you can no longer get the help you need. &nbsp;Counselors for unemployment regarding being unemployed, now that might be a good way to help people. &nbsp;Start a collection of positions that are there to aid people in getting over being unemployed. &nbsp;How is a person supposed to get the anger and emotional exhaustion out from being fired/laid off/voluntary quit in bad work environment, when they have no one to help them with it? &nbsp;Instead we drain our loved ones of their emotional well being, just increasing the turn of the cycle of poverty... &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
