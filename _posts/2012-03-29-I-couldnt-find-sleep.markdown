It evaded me, for as I was starting to drift my mind became awash with memories of my time at my previous employer.  I kept thinking about all the different things that happened to me.  About what I could have done to change things, what I could have done to make things better.  Were things my fault?  

I think about the anger that still fills me up.  When I think about how everyone supported her, and accepted her treatment of me.  Then I think of how incredibly alone I felt.  Anytime I see anything supportive of her, I am reminded of the lies.  

Last night as I tried to sleep I was reminded of the pain I experienced at her hands.  I am told that I had nightmares all night, ones where I whimpered in my sleep.  I didn't feel poorly rested this morning, and I don't remember a bad night's rest.  However my anger lingers...
