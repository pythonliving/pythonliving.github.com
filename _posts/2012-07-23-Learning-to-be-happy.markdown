After I graduated in 2006, for years I dreaded waking up and going to work.  There were some jobs where getting up, preparing myself for work and getting there was hard.  Making it through the shower and dressing myself and moving my way to work.  It was all about getting home.  Even then I was sad and stressed most evenings.  I was drained and unhappy.

Now I'm happy.  Yesterday I was trying to figure out why it's so much different now than it was before.  I think it's because I've learned to leave work at work.  It's amazing how much of a difference that makes.  Not stressing about work or your relationships from work when you're at home.  

Something about going through something so stressful and so horrid has taught me that **no job** is worth that.  Even if I start my own business and I love what I'm doing for a while, if it *ever* got that bad again, I would walk away.  I can walk away whenever I want to.  I know that now.

I ask myself, why do so many people think they can't quit a job they hate?  Why don't people leave jobs that make their life hell?  So many think they couldn't make ends meet.  People can survive on such much less than they think they can.  You just have to be willing to endure change and some difficulty for a short while, before things get so much better.  

I used to think I hated getting up early, but now I get up and get to work at 7:30 in the morning and I still have energy at the end of the day to do other things.  I have energy to make dinner instead of just making do.  I have energy to work on FlamingLunchbox things.  If you think you're unhappy with where you are professionally, be willing to scrutinize yourself and your job.  Is it you or the job?  Is it worth it?  If no, make a change.

On a side note I'm ran the [Dirty Dash](http://www.thedirtydash.com/) at Mt. Pisgah in Eugene with a very good friend of mine this past Saturday.  Here are [some pictures so you can see how very, very dirty we got](https://picasaweb.google.com/116317282302528753159/TheDirtyDash?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCKm8qP6zp6_FSg&feat=directlink).  As a side note, I tweaked my bad left ankle the night before, so the fact that I ran the race is something I'm rather proud of.  The fields were rather knobbly.  For those who enjoy running events for fun, I highly recommend this.
