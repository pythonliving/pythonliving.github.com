<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.26632348354905844"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most of you know what this is like. &nbsp;When you come upon a problem, could be a really simple problem, but for some reason it seems tougher than normal. &nbsp;So you put off climbing over this wall, you put off digging your hands in, and plan to do it the next day. &nbsp;But </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">what happens if all your problems have become a wall?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;What if your problems were big to begin with, but you get to a point with each one, that seems fairly complicated and insurmountable, that you don&rsquo;t know where to go or where to start?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">More than that, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">what happens when it&rsquo;s not actually happening to you, but to someone else you care about?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;What do you do then. &nbsp;How do you help them, but not be overbearing? &nbsp;I know what I would do if it was happening to me. &nbsp;Take it bit by bit, do small bits I know how to do, slowly getting it all together. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But telling someone that, and doing it yourself are different. &nbsp;You make suggestions all you want to this other person, but how much is that really going to help them? &nbsp;Especially when you&rsquo;ve had the conversation multiple times. &nbsp;Each conversation then is a reminder to the other person, of their wall. &nbsp;By talking about it, in the end, you&rsquo;ve simply stressed them out even more. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Having patience is one of the hardest things for me to do.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;It&rsquo;s something I always struggle with. &nbsp;When it comes to me learning to have patience with those I care about, I find life very difficult. &nbsp;Not only is my concern eating my up, but I&rsquo;m constantly striving to be more patient. &nbsp;But when you are in a situation such as this, patience is one of the few correct choices. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Support and patience. &nbsp;Difficult, stressful, but more rewarding than anything else you could be doing for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></div>
