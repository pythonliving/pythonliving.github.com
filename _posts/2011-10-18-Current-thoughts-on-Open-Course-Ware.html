font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;In general I believe highly in </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;

font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;As an active member, I realize how much of a difference having access to these materials makes. &nbsp;It </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">allows a person access not only to course materials, but lectures, readings, and sometimes forums where one can discuss the materials with others currently following it. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My current tendencies</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;

font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;I do not currently interact with the online forums and chat rooms for the Intro to Computer Science course I follow. &nbsp;I have chatted once or twice within the study group provided, but not at any depth. &nbsp;Despite my lack of interaction I&rsquo;ve still noticed that the amount of students participating in the course along with me is small. &nbsp;There are moderators that interact with the chat rooms and forums but they are also only interacting intermittently, as is appropriate considering the current volume in students. &nbsp;There is simply not a critical mass of students involved to require more constant interaction. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The thing I needed to make this work</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;

font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> The interactions that occur with this course are almost entirely via text, excepting recorded lectures available online. &nbsp;Personally </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">my best learning tends to come from verbal conversations</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> I have about the course material. &nbsp;Those conversations are what help me to process and better remember the information I am reviewing. &nbsp;That is not much of an option considering the course. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Luckily I have an additional resource of Robey (efficient and experienced programmer,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> who has taught before and acts like a tutor). &nbsp;With him I can have the discussions needed, and ask questions regarding many of the things that other would be programmers might have when beginning this course. &nbsp;Therefore I have had the necessary verbal communication I need to really learn the materials. &nbsp;If I hadn&rsquo;t had this resource, I cannot imagine myself having learned the material anywhere near as well. &nbsp;Having someone to talk to about the course is a serious advantage. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Despite my appreciation and support of Open Course Ware(OCW), I realize that unless I had someone who could either, a) act as a tutor and help answers as they come up, or at the very least b) be someone who would listen to my thoughts and chat with me about what I am learning, it might not work so well for me. &nbsp;Due to these concerns, I feel that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">finding a way to integrate more verbal communication is necessary for a higher level of success for OCW</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;It would make the courses accessible to a wider audience. &nbsp;There are many out there that would greatly benefit from OCW, this would be a great way to make those new feel welcome.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;

font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Not that the History Channel isn&rsquo;t awesome, but that&rsquo;s not what OCW is all about. &nbsp;There are some great options out there that solve this problem. &nbsp;One of the best ones I&rsquo;ve seen yet is </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="https://plus.google.com/up/start/?et=ad&amp;type=st">Google Hangout</a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;I think it would be awesome if some of the OCW courses would host Google Hangout sessions once a week, so students following the courses could stop by and chat with someone about their problems. &nbsp;There are graduate students already assisting with the online text chatter, why not up it a bit and talk with people face to face? &nbsp;It might also provide for the development of study groups originating from the students themselves.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Other interesting tidbits about online learning</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> - </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Previously I worked for </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/">Ecampus at Oregon State University</a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;Ecampus offers online courses and degrees, and when you graduate you receive an official degree from Oregon State University. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a pretty cool place, and the staff is made up of some pretty cool people. &nbsp;Through my time there I learned about virtual classrooms. &nbsp;One uses a virtual classroom by creating a personal 3d avatar, and through the world, attending your classes and chatting with classmates. &nbsp;Bascially World of Warcraft for educational purposes only. &nbsp;However, as far as I&rsquo;m aware, Ecampus doesn&rsquo;t offer virtual classrooms at this time. &nbsp;Nevertheless I feel that such virtual classrooms might offer another solution to this problem. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What else is it about OCW that needs tweaking?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> A higher level of organization of the course materials needs to be implemented. &nbsp;While the Intro to Computer Science course materials are organized, and the readings are set up with the course timeline, there are still some inconsistencies I&rsquo;ve found in the assigned problems. &nbsp;Often I&rsquo;ve found myself lost, simply because things are written out with less flow. &nbsp;The current course materials provided were originally created for a live audience. &nbsp;Online students don&rsquo;t get the benefit of the professor emphasizing that one or another course reading is more important, or when a professor points to particular aspects in the homework assignments. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve often found myself straining to keep up with a lecture, because class handouts that are not included in the course materials. &nbsp;Both professors will often refer to class handouts, and without them you&rsquo;re a little lost.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lastly, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">many OCW courses are created by high experts in the field</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;While it is fantastic that these people are taking their time to provide this information for the public at large, it creates a problem. &nbsp;Many experts tend to have a vocabulary and style of writing that is consistent with their field. &nbsp;This makes it sometimes difficult for the beginning learner to make a connection. &nbsp;Often I&rsquo;ve found an assignment written in a such a way that makes it very difficult for me to understand. &nbsp;When I have Robey review it to help me understand what they&rsquo;re asking for, he will often comment as to how it&rsquo;s almost written for a computer scientist. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s important to provide exposure to such writing styles, such a block in the beginning can highly deter an online learner from feeling able to learn the materials. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Imagine random Joe who starts following an OCW course. &nbsp;Things are going along swimmingly, then one day he hits a snag. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s having difficulties understanding the materials. &nbsp;He goes online to the study group and tries to contact someone regarding the problem. &nbsp;He gets some help, but for some reason it&rsquo;s not hitting the target. &nbsp;Now he&rsquo;s finding it hard to go any further in the course until he&rsquo;s gotten a chance to talk to someone about it (either via text or verbally)again. &nbsp;Considering the fact that random Joe is following this course in his spare time, after his 40 hours a week and other responsibilities are taken care of. &nbsp;That snag has now grown into a mountain, &nbsp;and the effort to reach the end result doesn&rsquo;t seem as worth it anymore. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What I&rsquo;m trying to get at is this. &nbsp;Open Course Ware is an amazing offering for many people. &nbsp;It provides them with the information and instruction they need, as long as they don&rsquo;t really come up against any serious learning hurdles. &nbsp;Once that happens it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that a large population of those learners will continue following the course. &nbsp;If you want to keep these people active within the community, and for the community to subsequently grow, you&rsquo;re going to need to provide more access opportunities. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not meaning tons of man hours, but simply allowing the students more tools to interact with either Grad students supporting the course, or simply more students following the course. &nbsp;Many of the concerns I brought up above could be solved by simply giving students easier ways to interact with each other. &nbsp;Provide them with a larger, easy to use, variety of ways to communicate about the information they&rsquo;re learning. &nbsp;If you can do that, then OCW is going to go somewhere and it&rsquo;s going to make a bigger difference.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /></div>
