title: How to find the balance, physically and mentally

<p>This is short today, as I've been lately focusing on my mental health. &nbsp;I just have two questions to ask. &nbsp;What do you do to take care of yourself mentally and physically? &nbsp;Do you find there is a delicate balance to making it work?</p>
<p>For myself I feel like I'm constantly battling my wish to be more mentally capable as well as pushing myself physically. &nbsp;Finding that balance is always a challenge. &nbsp;I enjoy a variety of sport activities (indoor soccer, ultimate frisbee, running, cycling, rock climbing, hiking, and yoga from time to time). &nbsp;I also enjoy learning constantly. &nbsp;Whether that be dead languages, live languages, reading non-fiction for fun, pursuing programming or delving back into piano and french horn when I feel I have the time. &nbsp;I just never have enough time. &nbsp;If I had enough time I would devote myself entirely to the study of all and the physical exertion of all activities that I listed above. &nbsp;But I don't have the time, and therefore must pick at choose. &nbsp;What do I devote myself to today? &nbsp;</p>
