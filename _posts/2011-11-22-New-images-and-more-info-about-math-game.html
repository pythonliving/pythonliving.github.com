<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve been working all day on this math game. &nbsp;As promised here is a &nbsp;little more detail about our game. &nbsp;First I&rsquo;ll show you a couple of sample spaceship images.</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent;"><img class="posterous_plugin_object posterous_plugin_object_image" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-11-22/jkzrcuxnyCGzxcDbcJnrsFDhactAmaEmBvzEtEEJpiDsCvCozaAclyIrnhcf/Spaceship1.png.thumb100.png?content_part=errqdpavAIqgfJIezDIF" alt="" width="100" height="100" /><img class="posterous_plugin_object posterous_plugin_object_image" src="http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-11-22/ytklHoIipexhmdpesnaFoGEbgCjEGyJmlkvaGkiDJBwchjzAsvhztFfHnyeo/Spaceship2.png.thumb100.png?content_part=kgdJdxcEyioqIyvdbGyB" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">These are a couple of our spaceships that are invading. &nbsp;The spaceships come across the screen towards your base. &nbsp;Your base will fire rockets at them and blow them up, but only if you answer the supplied math problem. &nbsp;There is a choice between simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication. &nbsp;In the future we&rsquo;re hoping to add in &lsquo;ten pair&rsquo; practice and number/letter recognition. &nbsp;This game is mainly aimed at providing a fun alternative for learning needed math skills for my nieces and nephews. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There will be a calculated score shown. &nbsp;Spaceships will explode (minor javascript stuffs), and I&rsquo;m aiming at shooting rockets towards them once a correct solution is submitted. &nbsp;There will also be a print option so that my nieces and nephews can play the game and practice, then print the screen to show their parents how many points they&rsquo;ve scored. &nbsp;That way parents can use it to track practice. &nbsp;Points only go up with correct answers, in more difficult settings incorrect answers will take away points (and in the future create additional ships coming towards you).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My hope is to offer a couple of adjustment options in the Menu bar, mainly difficulty setting and the ability to specify problem type. &nbsp;In total I&rsquo;m hoping to get the rough version out on Thanksgiving. &nbsp;My translation services haven&rsquo;t been in much need this week, so I&rsquo;ve devoted myself to developing this game to jump start my jQuery/javascript education. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In the future I will be adding a tutorial option, so that people can learn how it works (mainly so that younger children can learn with fewer spaceships in the beginning and move up to more difficult levels). &nbsp;I hope to add simple shining stars, possible multiple ships per row, sharing tools, and maybe a way for a person to keep track of their total score (or a way to share that as well). &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: Symbol shock and subsequent javascript woes</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
