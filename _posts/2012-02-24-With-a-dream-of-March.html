<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.33111864351667464" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So yesterday I had a panic attack. &nbsp;This was definitely different than what I&rsquo;ve experienced in the past. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t breathe, and the room was getting smaller. &nbsp;I went for a walk to steady my breathing but when I returned the air felt heavy and thick. &nbsp;As the night wore on things went from something I could handle to worse. &nbsp;The evening ended with me digging up and talking about old memories that are rather painful to reminisce. &nbsp;Suffice it to say I&rsquo;m kind of trying to avoid the day, get some work done, but otherwise not pay attention. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s almost a year to the day since I quit my last job. &nbsp;A year to the day when I turned in my notice that I wasn&rsquo;t going to work for a company I felt didn&rsquo;t respect me. &nbsp;A year to the day since I was escorted off the premises a day after I had turned in my two weeks notice. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m definitely doing better, but I&rsquo;ve got a different ball of wax to deal with now. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still dealing with a serious lack in self confidence. &nbsp;I look at craigslist and I wonder if I could successfully do a job at a grocery store without getting poor reviews. &nbsp;However that only happens when I&rsquo;m low, and the stress eats at me. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But this is not all the time, it has only been stronger of late. &nbsp;My hopes are for a March that shines and allows me some respite from my woes. &nbsp;One that allows me to find a calm center so I can watch my garden grow. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
