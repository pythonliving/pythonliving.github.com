<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.721103832591325"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Earlier last week I was over obsessing about SOPA. &nbsp;I posted about it on twitter at least 2 to 3 times, and many more on my facebook account. &nbsp;As always Twitter responds with interest, but those on my facebook account, for the most part, simply ignored it. &nbsp;Why would someone not want to get involved in this? &nbsp;At the very least they could sign a petition or call their representative. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was really disappointed in the overall amount of interaction. &nbsp;There are so many people I know to whom the effects of SOPA would be important. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I honestly can&rsquo;t understand why people wouldn&rsquo;t at least email their representative.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;After thinking about it for a while I came up with two main reasons. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One, they think that interacting with SOPA at all will get them somehow labeled as an Internet pirate. &nbsp;Two, they don&rsquo;t want to make the effort.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Number one seems simply....well, for lack of a better word, retarded. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you don&rsquo;t support SOPA &nbsp;it doesn&rsquo;t make you an Internet Pirate.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;That is simply the rhetoric of those who support it. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what THEY want you to think.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Number two, well, I thought the Internet made the second reason pretty much obsolete. </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Prior to email and the &lsquo;Interwebs&rsquo;, interacting in the political scene meant going somewhere to sign a petition, and calling or sending letters to your representative. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now you can simply see a link to a petition or an automatic email generator and you can take part.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;You can make your voice be known at the click of a button. &nbsp;This cuts down the time and effort drastically, and one would think the increase in political activity would have been fairly noticeable. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the things I always find funny is when people joke about how full their email inbox is. &nbsp;How much email they get, and how they it just keeps piling up. &nbsp;An inbox can handle thousands of pieces of email, but should it? </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t letting your email pile up just like piling up unpaid bills?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Half of the paperwork you get mailed is probably just printed copies of online transactions when you paid online. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What&rsquo;s the important factor here? &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As the means become easier to communicate, so does the communication increase. &nbsp;That means that instead of people taking their time to write a well thought out letter, or input all the necessary details in a bank statement, you&rsquo;re getting minute by minute updates. &nbsp;Thus thousands of emails sitting in your inbox. &nbsp;But along with those thousands of emails is thousands of easily sortable pieces of information. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We always know when certain emails are worth our time to look at more, or if others are simply notifications.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;It&rsquo;s easy to simply shuttle them off into organization files in your Inbox, keep them Unread, and take care of sections all at once. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Anyways, yes, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">you can keep your inbox clean. &nbsp;Stop trying to convince yourself of otherwise. </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Organizing your inbox will do your brain a world of good when you more easily process the information your receiving. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But, once again, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">how does this pertain to political interaction?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Just as so many people hesitate to sort their inbox, so many people can&rsquo;t find it in them to click on a button. &nbsp;What if these people are trying to scam them into signing something they actually don&rsquo;t agree with? &nbsp;Most often people simply feel they don&rsquo;t know enough to make that decision. &nbsp;They are simply too busy with other things in their life, and have moved political involvement to the bottom of their ToDo list. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What does this mean? &nbsp;What am I trying to get at? &nbsp;Keep your inbox clean, respond sooner to things, don&rsquo;t put it off. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you don&rsquo;t beat around the bush at doing things, then you&rsquo;ll actually find you have the time to do the things you want to do, like be happy and crochet. &nbsp;Or to tell your Representative to vote NO on SOPA.</span></strong></div>
