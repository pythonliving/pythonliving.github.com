font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">the person has developed a personal sense of hope and empowerment that wasn&rsquo;t there before. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">*these are approx. definitions found from various online sources.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I don&rsquo;t know if &lsquo;recovery&rsquo; can be so easily defined. &nbsp;I know what I used to feel at my old job. &nbsp;I constantly felt powerless to stop what was happening. &nbsp;For a while everyday I would get ready for work and be frightened at the things I would be made to feel or experience. &nbsp;I was scared of the pain and hurt and humiliation I felt when coming to work. &nbsp;The distrust and embarrassment that occurred. &nbsp;The nights when I would come home and simply cry and talk all night about how much I hated it there. &nbsp;How I couldn&rsquo;t believe that someone would treat me like this. &nbsp;How small I felt. &nbsp;How I didn&rsquo;t feel like I could do anything to make it better. &nbsp;I would try but then it would just make things worse. &nbsp;When I would go to hang out with my friends and still feel my heart pull and clench because of stress. &nbsp;When I couldn&rsquo;t focus on anything except how to make things better at work. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In order to have hope I think you need to have control of the stress and pain in your life. &nbsp;I </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">think</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> the stress is gone. &nbsp;Being self employed I feel more empowered now that I have full control of my job at FlamingLunchbox. &nbsp;I know what I&rsquo;m not doing, and there is only so much I know or can do. &nbsp;That helps a lot, but I still feel fear and humiliation anytime I think I&rsquo;m doing things wrong. &nbsp;Once that starts happening my brain just stops processing, and I slow down to a crawl productivity wise. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The pain is NOT gone. &nbsp;I can smile at people from the old job when I seem them in stores, but afterwards I feel humiliated and embarrassed and worry about what they think of me. &nbsp;Of what everyone may have said about me. &nbsp;About the lies my old boss told about me. &nbsp;About the horrible person they might think I am. &nbsp;Then I walk away quickly because I don&rsquo;t want to hear it, I don&rsquo;t want to try to explain. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to know. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the best reaction, but it&rsquo;s what I can handle right now. &nbsp;Some days if I think about my old boss all it makes me want to do is be violent. &nbsp;But my anger has nowhere to go, so I cry. &nbsp;Then I cry because she still has power over me. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, no, I guess I haven&rsquo;t &lsquo;recovered.&rsquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;
