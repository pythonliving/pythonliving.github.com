<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This past weekend I was fairly busy working on a new side project of ours. &nbsp;This side project is a math learning tool for my nieces and nephews in HTML5. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a space invaders type game, with graphics created by yours truly, where for each successfully solved problem a creature is blown up. &nbsp;This is my first time through the entire game development process. &nbsp;Robey is helping me along, but I&rsquo;m writing most of the code. &nbsp;On top of that I&rsquo;ve also been learning how to use a different text editor than the one I had been using (Sublime Text), Vim. &nbsp;Vim has a variety of different key-stroke combinations that made writing code in the beginning a little choppy, but it&rsquo;s slowly becoming much easier, and in some cases surprisingly faster. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There are some awesome things about this text editor that don&rsquo;t exist in the one I&rsquo;ve tended to use. &nbsp;One example is the easy copy/paste key-strokes, that is once you get used to them. &nbsp;You can copy paste things via key-stroke simply by hitting the number for the amount of lines below where you are that you want to copy, and then hit </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">d</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> twice in quick succession. &nbsp;That then deletes the amount of lines you selected from the code. &nbsp;However, they are not permanently deleted, as they are now accessible if you simply type the letter &lsquo;p&rsquo;. &nbsp;Just locate yourself within the text as appropriate, and it allows you to simply copy that same text as much as you want. &nbsp;In many way I feel that this kind of key-stroke would be helpful for writers in a word file.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Some key strokes definitely slowed things up at first, mainly the save key-stroke combination. &nbsp;To save you must hit the </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">esc</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> key if you&rsquo;re in edit mode and then type in </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">:w</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> and hit enter to save. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so attuned to the ctrl+s combination that I using it quite often still when learning the new save method. &nbsp;I also had a hard time remembering to type in </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">i</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> when I wanted to type in anything. &nbsp;I do enjoy using just my keyboard if possible, so I think that I will find many of these combinations to be much more natural as time goes on. &nbsp;It also helps that some of these key combinations will be added into our Kickstarter text editor project, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Betwixt</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The last thing I wanted to mention about Vim, was that the original screen coloring really threw me off. &nbsp;At one point when we were discussing the organization of the HTML (which I&rsquo;ve interacted with HTML a fair amount and know most of the terms/organization), I had serious issues even understanding what Robey was asking me about because I wasn&rsquo;t connecting the screen I was looking at with the HTML I knew. &nbsp;So when I had simply typed in some </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">divs</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> without thinking about nesting, Robey tried to walk me through why it would be a bad idea...which I couldn&rsquo;t even understand what he was talking about. &nbsp;That just reminds me how much a simple change in font and organization can block understanding. &nbsp;One could also think of it as akin to symbol shock. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;
