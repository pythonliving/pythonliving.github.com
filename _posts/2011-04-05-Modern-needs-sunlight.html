<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3372803481761366" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What was it that our fathers and our forefathers had that we don&rsquo;t? &nbsp;What are those stories we hear, or joke about hearing. &nbsp;&ldquo;I walked 50 miles to and from school, up hill both ways.&rdquo; &nbsp;Or phrases like, &ldquo;When I was your age we had to go visit the Post Office to call someone.&rdquo; &nbsp;Or, &ldquo;The things they have in the stores now-a-days. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a modern miracle.&rdquo; &nbsp;Despite all, I feel that had something that we don&rsquo;t really get enough of in modern society. &nbsp;They had sunlight. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So much of what modern society has brought us is convenience. &nbsp;That way it&rsquo;s easier for people to work 60 hours a week indoors. &nbsp;They can just walk to the corner, or even within their own building and grab their lunch. &nbsp;Yet, we still have a society rife with phrases that emphasize a love of the natural environment. &nbsp;&ldquo;A breath of fresh air,&rdquo; is one of the most significant of these. &nbsp;Over the past 3 or 4 days, as I&rsquo;ve had a chance to interact with my friends more I&rsquo;ve learned that everyone misses the sun. &nbsp;Everyone wishes they had more time to be outdoors during the day. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Look at the increase in research on the need for vitamin D. &nbsp;The amount needed by humans only seems to increase with each newly published article. &nbsp;Why is there a wish for fresh cut flowers, or plants inside as well? &nbsp;So many people bring the outdoors inside if they can&rsquo;t get enough on their own. &nbsp;Some people can have virtual gardens at their desk. &nbsp;Even those people who forget to water, or consistently over-water their plants keep buying new ones every once in a while. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I am convinced that one of the greatest things that our forefathers had was walking those &ldquo;50 miles to and from school or work&rdquo;. &nbsp;Everything was a bit slower as the technology and modern convenience of today hadn&rsquo;t really kicked in. People simply had to spend more time outdoors each day, where they could do nothing but commute without Ipods or cellphones to keep them from getting bored. &nbsp;They had to breathe in the fresh air, and just think while walking to and from their errands. &nbsp;What a horrid prospect! &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Germans have a literary term that reflects on this idea. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Der Spaziergang.&rdquo; &nbsp;It basically means, to go for a walk without a reason. &nbsp;In other words, to go for a walk without needing a destination, simply going for a walk to go on a walk. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s represented in their literature in a variety of ways, but the idea is there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Having the ability to do this now, to walk just for the sake of walking because of my self-employment, this is one of the most satisfying parts of my new life. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the one that I would envy others for. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the one that so many talk about wanting to do when at work. &nbsp;Having the flexibility and the ability to be outside. &nbsp;</span></div>
