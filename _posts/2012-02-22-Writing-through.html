<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5415263706818223" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Often the only thing I find solace in are the words that find their way onto the page. &nbsp;The words on my page, the words that I write. &nbsp;Sometimes when my emotions overwhelm me I yearn for a laptop and a quite corner where I can tap away and cry in solitude. &nbsp;Despite friendships and relationships I believe we all have lonely days when average actions compel us to trust no one. &nbsp;When it feels that there is only the push and wrenching of others who want, yearn, or prey on your peace. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What was I thinking with self pity...more like self gratitude. &nbsp;Recognizing the depth of our own wealth of emotions and realizing how much we&rsquo;ve gone through. &nbsp;We all experience pain and loss, exuberance and gaiety. &nbsp;How can I judge a man, a man learning to be a man as I learn to be a woman, differently than I do myself? &nbsp;How can I judge a child who doesn&rsquo;t want to go to school when I myself have days of depression that keep me from working. &nbsp;Days when my mind seems forever clouded and weary, not wishing for anything but the short distraction of my fairy tales. &nbsp;How have I any right to say anything to him?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One thing I realized today was that no matter what happens in the future, writing as I do now has changed my life. &nbsp;Writing has helped me not only to recognize my short comings, but it allows me to search my soul. &nbsp;I know that my writings probably bore others. &nbsp;I am probably telling just a bit too much about my depressions and negative feelings. &nbsp;But I can&rsquo;t stop. &nbsp;Something inside me tells me that others must feel this way too. &nbsp;I know that I&rsquo;m not alone. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not the only one who fights these thoughts and emotions. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a bad person for feeling this way, I simply question myself. &nbsp;If I don&rsquo;t share it, then I feel like I&rsquo;m giving up on others who feel the same way I do. &nbsp;I would be giving up on being honest to myself and the world. &nbsp;If I don&rsquo;t do this then the unknown &lsquo;others&rsquo; have control over me, and I will succumb to my own fear. &nbsp;</span><br /></strong></p>
