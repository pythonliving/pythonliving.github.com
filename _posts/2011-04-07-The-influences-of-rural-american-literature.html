<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most of American Rural literature is written about a love of nature, and living in the country. &nbsp;Living in Corvallis, Oregon I am surrounded by many who share the same ideal, despite living in a small city. &nbsp;A want to know your neighbor, to stick your hands in the earth and see the beetles crawl up your arm. &nbsp;A recent article was published in the </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/us/06farmers.html"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">New York Times</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, about a new generation of Oregon Farmers. &nbsp;However I find there is a new generation of do-it-yourselfers. &nbsp;Those who want to can their own food, or have their own chickens, make their own food. &nbsp;A generation who wants to drink their own morning coffee and afternoon tea, enjoy the sun, make your own socks and sweaters. &nbsp;</span></p>
