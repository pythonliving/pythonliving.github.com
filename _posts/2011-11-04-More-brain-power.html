<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, if you hadn&rsquo;t heard, I recently began working for a local pharmaceutical company as a German translator. &nbsp;They work with some German speaking companies and I help them out with whatever they want me to do. &nbsp;Much of what I do is translating documents from German into English.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I really enjoy working with German again. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great challenge, and I have a fair amount of control over how my work hours for them interact with my other job (FlamingLunchbox stuffs). &nbsp;However I still find myself with a kind of brain-drain at the end of it. &nbsp;I find it difficult to transition from one mentally taxing project to another. &nbsp;The best that I can come up with, so far, is to either do my translation more in a couple of days and then leave another couple of days free for FlamingLunchbox work. &nbsp;Entirely free, that way when the brain-drain occurs, it&rsquo;s only related to one particular aspect. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s a little difficult for me to follow that pattern consistently however because my new job has varying deadlines. &nbsp;Thus it makes following an actual schedule more difficult to maintain, but not impossible. &nbsp;More of my days actually filled with work entirely. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not all that bad, simply....draining. &nbsp;Sweet weekend, you&rsquo;re here. &nbsp;</span></div>
