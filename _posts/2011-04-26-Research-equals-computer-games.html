<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.44208827591501176" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After a week of feeling like utter desolation I&rsquo;m starting to roll again. &nbsp;Nothing is better than a bunch of great people offering to meet up for coffee/lunch/because they care. &nbsp;Not worrying to remind me of how great they think I am, because it&rsquo;s so intrinsic for them, but simply stating that they want to be here to support me. &nbsp;It was a wonderful feeling, and I would like to dedicate this post to my friends, who are quite amazing and make my life so great.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m now at a point, in helping get this business started, that I&rsquo;ve done most of the work. &nbsp;Now I simply have tons of learning to do. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve redone the FlamingLunchbox website, created my blog and done most of the research in order to determine the advertising agencies (aka AdSense, Admob and whatnot else). &nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, I&rsquo;ve completed most of the &lsquo;work&rsquo; work. &nbsp;Now it&rsquo;s all reading and writing. &nbsp;At least, until a new product is published, which should be soon. &nbsp;Then it&rsquo;s all roller-coasters and octopus rides until we get a handle on it all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A day riddled with Inkscape tutorials, blogging, perhaps a Tweet or two, and some readings for the MIT course. &nbsp;It sounds like fun. &nbsp;This all, of course, shall also be accompanied with physical training, playing the women&rsquo;s intermediate game, and perhaps some Magicka later tonight? :)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s not my fault, Robey purchased it and calls it &ldquo;research&rdquo;.</span></div>
