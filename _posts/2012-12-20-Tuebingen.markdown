This past Saturday Robey, Jens and I went to [Tuebingen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCbingen).  We used this awesome service called [Dein Bus](http://www.deinbus.de/), which allows you and other people to request specific bus travel needs within Germany.

This is particularly interesting, because the bus infrastructure in Germany is restricted so much that Bus routes don't really exist for longer distances.  Especially at the prices that you get on this site.  So if you're looking to travel in Germany, check out **deinbus.de** before you go to the Deutsche Bahn.

Alright, back to Tuebingen.  We took a bus down, and then met Jens' friend, Tilo.  He was an amazing guide to the city, especially in the 6 hours we were there.  We saw the city, starting with a walk to a cafe and the Weihnachtsmarkt.  Then up to a Schloss.

At the Schloss we had a great view of the surrounding countryside, during which we had to take a quick, awesome picture break.

We went to a classic Swabishes resturaunt for lunch, where we ate what else; sausage, potatoes and sauerkraut.  Well Swabisch versions at least.  Afterwards Tilo gave us a ride and fantastic tour of the Bebenhaus Monastery, which I'll tell you about next time.
