<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5987292125355452"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s been a bit since my last full on blog entry. &nbsp;Working translation every week is still a bit draining as I do my 4 or 5 hours in the mornings. &nbsp;Then I allow my afternoon/evenings to be devoted to normal work. &nbsp;I shouldn&rsquo;t really be drinking coffee this late in the day, but once the sun goes down I find it difficult to concentrate otherwise.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lately life has been very stressful for the FlamingLunchbox crew. &nbsp;Holidays have a tendency to do that, it seems. &nbsp;Visiting family, not actually able to focus on work for a while, both accentuate normal stresses beyond regular levels simply from the change. &nbsp;In total we were unable to work for about 5 days. &nbsp;As we left with some still unfinished projects hanging over our heads, it was perhaps a bit less relaxing than it ought to have been. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s difficult when you hope to get particular goals finished by a certain trip date, and unexpected complications crop up. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To help us to continue to strive and be productive we have defined a couple of New Years resolutions for the upcoming year. &nbsp;The best part is the moment we returned home we started working on them. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We&rsquo;ve instituted a work-schedule.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;We have to </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">be at our desks at 8 am</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, even if the work we do is crap for that first hour. &nbsp;We must </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">stop all work at 7pm</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;That makes us focus more on actually getting work done during the time we&rsquo;ve allotted ourselves.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I briefly discussed that we had started running on a regular basis together. &nbsp;Breaks always tend to mess with your routine, and it did so with ours. &nbsp;However we are back, and </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">we started running again today</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re only running a mile, but we make sure to do almost every day of the week. &nbsp;Our New Years resolution is to run everyday, at least a mile and work up as we want to. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a long distance, and we&rsquo;re not necessarily pushing hard, but there is something to say about completing a short run each day. &nbsp;When you look back at what you did, you can always say to yourself...I ran...and then you can smile.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our last mutual New Years resolution, is </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">to do all of our dishes every evening before we retire for the night.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;This may not seem like a lot to those of you who own a microwave or dishwasher, but we have neither. &nbsp;This means many pots to clean by hand. &nbsp;If we both simply make sure it happens each night it won&rsquo;t feel like as much of a chore anymore. &nbsp;This was greatly inspired by Robey&rsquo;s parents, as they really have a system down when it comes to cleaning their kitchen each evening. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I feel like a lot of my own stress was coming from continuously feeling like I wasn&rsquo;t getting enough done, that the house never seemed clean, and I was never working enough to stay fit. &nbsp;Add on to that my worry-wart tendencies and I&rsquo;ve got cancerous sores everywhere....you get the picture. &nbsp;Cutting it down to three categories that both Robey and I can work on together is going to help us both make the changes we want. &nbsp;Working from home it&rsquo;s very difficult to separate your job and play sometimes. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s even more difficult when parts of your job is to play. &nbsp;Oi!</span><br /></strong></div>
