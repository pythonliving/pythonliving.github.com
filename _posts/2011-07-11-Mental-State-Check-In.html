<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5625935248099267" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I think of getting an actual job I&rsquo;m not as afraid. &nbsp;My fear is calming down, and I can handle considering it. &nbsp;However, anytime I think of getting a job in the Academic or Administrative side I start to get a little panicky. &nbsp;Anything that reminds me of that atmosphere is traumatizing. &nbsp;Then I think of getting another type of job and my mind calms down. &nbsp;I think of yard work or more simplistic positions and I don&rsquo;t fret. &nbsp;I know those are temporary situations and that I would be so much less invested in the whole job to worry as much about needing to leave if it was a bad situation.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And that comes to the crux of my previous situation. &nbsp;The reason that my former position, and the situation that came from it, was so traumatizing for me was because I was invested in it. &nbsp;I believed I had more of a chance to make significant progress in my career through this position and company than any other. &nbsp;What happened was the feeling that I was being severely prevented by forces that were not under my control. &nbsp;If anything, these forces were hurting my chances of making anything of myself for a while. &nbsp;Never before had I felt so controlled by my superiors. &nbsp;Never before had I felt so stifled. &nbsp;I had tried so hard to make things work, and I had worked so hard to get the work done. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I admit, I wasn&rsquo;t perfect. &nbsp;I admit I made mistakes. &nbsp;I admit that I&rsquo;m human. &nbsp;I feel that under the situation I was presented with I did an amazing job. &nbsp;I do a good job. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m a decent human being, and I deserve to be treated as such. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Thus I saved myself. &nbsp;I choose to leave. &nbsp;I choose to make a leap and attempt to drastically change my life for the better. &nbsp;I choose to learn to program. &nbsp;I still have stress, and there are still things in my life I need to work on, but I can tell you right now I am happier than I&rsquo;ve been in many, many years. &nbsp;I feel more capable. &nbsp;I feel driven. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m excited about what I&rsquo;m doing. &nbsp;I can actually realize that the people around me want to support me. &nbsp;That they care for me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not questioning my friends or my family. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not imaging (as much at least), that everyone is simply putting up with me anymore. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m starting to realize what an amazing person I am. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m recognizing I make mistakes, but I&rsquo;m not as torn up by it. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m happy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m generally happy; isn&rsquo;t that Crazy?!?</span></div>
