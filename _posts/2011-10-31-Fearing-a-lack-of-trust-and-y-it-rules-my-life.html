<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the overwhelming factors that I fight against, emotionally, is the fear that others will not trust me. &nbsp;The fear that I will say something, and that others will think I am manipulating the statement, or them. &nbsp;Much of this fear stems from my life during college. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was confronted by one of the professors in my department (who I never actually took a course from), that I was considered a flake. &nbsp;That I would make false promises. &nbsp;I had a break down that evening, ending with me sitting in a bathtub with a bottle of wine by my side. &nbsp;I was so afraid of others not trusting me. &nbsp;This experience was somewhat emotionally scarring because it presented me with a new fear. &nbsp;That despite my intelligence I was not something people would want in whatever form. &nbsp;I would not be sought after for assistance or help, because I was a flake. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As I&rsquo;ve grown older (which being 28 I&rsquo;m far from being &lsquo;mature&rsquo;), I&rsquo;ve learned why I acted that way. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I had a tendency to over plan, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">all the time</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Through this over planning I end up scheduling things too closely, often. &nbsp;Then on day two of my five day week I would have found myself overstressed and not knowing how to solve my conflicts. &nbsp;I wanted to help or be a part of so much that I would over commit. &nbsp;I worked part-time consistently during college(outside of my freshman year in the dorms). &nbsp;For half of college I lived in a town 45 minutes away, and part of the time I was home I would also help out and babysit my sisters kids. &nbsp;This made it incredibly difficult to take part in all of these activities and things I wanted to do. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Another important part of why I acted that way is that I had a tendency to sound very wishy-washy about what I wanted to do. &nbsp;I would be really interested but was never sure if I could make it or not. &nbsp;Unfortunately I would say things in a wishy-washy fashion, leaving everyone, including myself, confused. &nbsp;This caused several frustrating conflicts until I learned to more capably express myself. &nbsp;Often people would have gotten the impression that I had agreed to do something, when I had not intended to give that impression whatsoever from my own statements. &nbsp;It was definitely a form of miscommunication, one that I have steadily gotten better at preventing over time.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The last aspect that I had to learn to control, was my interactions with my family. &nbsp;It was, by far, one of the most influential in why I was a flake. &nbsp;My family didn&rsquo;t make me a flake, but the decisions I made because of and for my family, made me look like one. &nbsp;Most of my life I have had to struggle with boundary issues. &nbsp;Many of the things I was brought up with, expectations that were set from my family, made my adult life difficult. &nbsp;Often many of the expectations I was raised with would directly conflict with those expectations of my peers here in the north-west. &nbsp;Learning which path and what choices I wanted to make as an adult; those choices were incredibly hard. &nbsp;At one point I saw a counselor who specifically spoke with me about these concerns and issues, and helped me to learn how to make the choices that would be best for me. &nbsp;I am still learning to accept the way things were and how to still have my own boundaries intact with regards to my family. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve made some personal changes to combat this fear and subsequent causes. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned to cut back on my commitments, especially </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">learned when to say yes and when to emphasize that I don&rsquo;t know if I can make it (or simply say no).</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I am also clearer in expressing my decision than I was previously.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Now when I make a commitment I am able to give most of myself without the fear of disappointing someone. &nbsp;I now know that others will trust me when I say I will be there. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A recent experience helped to emphasize this for me. &nbsp;I was hanging out, drinking a beer after a soccer game with some friends, and I was asked by an acquaintance to play for his team the following weekend. &nbsp;At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure I wanted to/was able to, and was therefore a bit wishy/washy about the whole thing. &nbsp;However Robey emphasized he would be interested in helping too, so I agreed to play. &nbsp;The acquaintance made a comment about not being sure I would be there, but then another friend piped up and said that if I said I would be there I would be there. &nbsp;Continuing she said, &ldquo;If I had still been uncommitted then I was definitely uncommitted, but if I said I would play I would be there&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hearing your friends stick up for you, and verify that you are a responsible individual to others is incredibly satisfying. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: I have no idea folks...this new job has cut down on my writing time so you&rsquo;ll get whatever I can produce by Tuesday! &nbsp;</span></div>
