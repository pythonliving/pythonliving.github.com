<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.09580144402571023" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I try to start most mornings now with crunches and a protein shake. &nbsp;I swear, a strong core is the solution to so many health problems. &nbsp;I wish more people enjoyed crunches the way I do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Time for more learning and programming today. &nbsp;Hopefully it will treat me better than yesterday. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Yesterday was a long day, one full of depression and anxiety. &nbsp;I ended up playing Tales of Monkey Island for 4 or 5 hours. &nbsp;If I wasn&rsquo;t in a &lsquo;short on cash&rsquo; mode, I might have done something else. &nbsp;I normally visit a couple friends of mine, good friends, who do massage and facials. &nbsp;I never used to partake much in the relaxation arts, but once my work life and subsequent stress started getting the better of me such visits became a mainstay. &nbsp;Now I enjoy supporting their business, as seeing them always leaves me in a better mood. &nbsp;I usually would see them once a month when I was employed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To add on to my list of downers, for about 5 months I&rsquo;ve been having some pretty serious issues with my left leg. &nbsp;They have been serious enough that I&rsquo;ve been seeing a Physical Therapist for it. &nbsp;Normally I&rsquo;m fairly physically active, playing on several soccer teams, so being injured has been a trying experience. &nbsp;Normally I see many of my friends when playing soccer, or afterwards. &nbsp;Having that mainstay activity out of my schedule has been very frustrating. &nbsp;So, in order to speed my recovery, I&rsquo;ve also been seeing my friend who does deep tissue massage. &nbsp;Slowly improvements are occurring, and I&rsquo;m noticing an increase in overall &ldquo;wellness&rdquo;, as it were.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I simply cannot emphasize how much massages make me a happier person. &nbsp;I say, If you&rsquo;re stressed, seriously, go get a massage. </span></div>
