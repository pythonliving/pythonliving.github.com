<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1170517192222178"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I saw my old boss for the first time this past Sunday. &nbsp;She was driving down the road in the opposite direction. &nbsp;I was heading towards a soccer game. &nbsp;She had a smirk on her face. &nbsp;I felt...hardly anything. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was so surprising how little it affected me. &nbsp;After a little bit I had my momentary feelings of anger and frustration. &nbsp;Mainly feelings of resentment. &nbsp;Knowing how much </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I want her to see me succeed, and realize how wrong she was about it, about me.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;But what does this really mean?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That somewhere deep inside me I still think that they might be partially right, and it scares me. &nbsp;Somewhere I still feel like I wasn&rsquo;t doing enough, or trying hard enough. &nbsp;I feel that everyday. &nbsp;How can I ever expect to get over that feeling, unless I&rsquo;m able to accept myself? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a slacker. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a poor worker, but I know </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I have fairly high expectations of myself. &nbsp;If I don&rsquo;t meet some of those expectations I chide myself.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t accept the mistakes. &nbsp;Because I can&rsquo;t accept my mistakes from my time at my last job, because I know I have the capability to have noticed them. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t pushing myself hard enough. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, in the darkest places of my mind, they had a right to blame me.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How do you know when your work is good enough? &nbsp;Where is the cut off point? &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Where do you know that it wasn&rsquo;t you</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, and it had nothing to do with your work ethic, it had to do with someone else not pulling their weight? &nbsp;Especially if they are doing their best to cover their own....backside?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The one thing I could think about when seeing my former boss was that </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I want her to know she was wrong about me.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;That I&rsquo;m intelligent and hard working and that all of her concerns and criticisms were unjust. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I wanted to prove her wrong. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What would that do?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Why do I care what her opinion is of me anymore? &nbsp;I still let her have power over me. &nbsp;I want justice for the wrongful way I feel I was treated. &nbsp;I want an apology. &nbsp;I want recognition from them. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How do you take the step back from your dark places? &nbsp;How do you forgive when you still anger? &nbsp;How do you let go? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still working on that one. &nbsp;Is time and simply forgetfulness the answer to letting go? &nbsp;Is it required to forgive the person? &nbsp;What if they were right? &nbsp;They undoubtedly think so, so then, if they will always feel they are right how do I go on when I want them to admit their fault? &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My emotions want validation, but no one else went through what I went through with me.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The only validation I can receive is from myself, and I don&rsquo;t seem to trust myself enough to realize I couldn&rsquo;t have done anything else.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;I must forgive myself, and accept myself for all my faults. &nbsp;I must learn to be okay with days when I lack focus, or days when things are harder than normal. &nbsp;They occur for everyone. &nbsp;Once I can accept and I can fully recognize that my emotions were valid, and I will no longer care. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But humans, we are an odd bunch. &nbsp;Many of us need validation from those around us. &nbsp;We need others. &nbsp;We are not creatures that can easily live on our own. &nbsp;We need company, either large or small, we need the approval of others. &nbsp;In the end, it&rsquo;s really that I need these things. &nbsp;If I need these things (validation, acceptance, approval, company) from others, but I cannot truly trust my own self interpretations, how can I expect them to feel the same way about me? &nbsp;I cannot trust what comes out of my mouth, so how should I expect them to? &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once I accept and trust myself I will find peace. &nbsp;I must not expect others to provide it for me.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span></strong></div>
