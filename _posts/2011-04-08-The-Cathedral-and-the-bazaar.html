Raymond. It begins by discussing the history of the Internet (or ARPANET). &nbsp;It also discusses computers and programming that I&rsquo;ve never even heard about. &nbsp;I wonder how the strides in technology over these past 20 years will be viewed in history. &nbsp;I wonder if they&rsquo;re in any high school text books yet. &nbsp;I still remember using MS-DOS to get into Simon the Sorcerer, or the old green screen Oregon Trail. Duke Nukem.....there was a fun game. Simplistic yet addicting. &nbsp;How will the gaming industry, and the boom in computer and gaming systems be seen by future generations?</span><br /><br /><br /></div>
