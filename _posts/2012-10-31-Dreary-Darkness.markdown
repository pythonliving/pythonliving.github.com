Over the past two weeks I've been slowly getting more and more closed in.  I don't want to leave the house, I don't want to do anything really.  It's been cloudy Oregon, but more so than normal.  It's been dreary, damp, warmer than it should be, and dark.

I've also been really tight on money for the past two weeks, and by tight I mean my money has been almost non-existent.  It's amazing how much not having any money can affect your self-esteem.  How it can make you feel ashamed like it's your fault, when sometimes that's just the way the things go.  

I've also been a little obsessive about playing *Torchlight 2*.  All of those things combined have made me a bit of a shut in and a bit depressed.  So I started taking 4000 IU's of Vitamin D this week.

I also started rock climbing again!  It's awesome, and a heck of a lot easier than I remember.  I think that might have something to do with the amount of pushups I've been doing and the upper body workout I get from work, moving heavier objects around all the time.     

However, today is Halloween!  An excuse to dress up, eat candy, be silly and have a good time.  This also means that tomorrow is the day one of 50% to 75% of the halloween goods at the thrift stores!!  Yes, that gets me excited. 

HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!
