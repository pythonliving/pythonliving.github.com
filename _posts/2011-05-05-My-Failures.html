<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6452601898927242" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There was a blogger, Emilie Wapnick (</span><a href="http://puttylike.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Puttylike</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">), who declared a &lsquo;Failure Week&rsquo;. &nbsp;A week when everyone could post or blog about their failures. &nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;ve already missed &lsquo;Failure Week&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;m going to blog about it anyways. &nbsp;I think it will help me towards self enlightenment (which in my mind means learning to be okay with being wrong).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I like lists, so I&rsquo;ll do this in a list:</span><br /><ol>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In 5th grade I didn&rsquo;t win an art contest. &nbsp;Those who won, were allowed to take part in helping to paint the new reading room at the public library. &nbsp;I was never a very good artist, and they had said that the winners wouldn&rsquo;t just be people who were good at art, but also those who tried hard and worked well with other people. &nbsp;I had been sitting at a table with one of the more difficult people to work with in our class, and I tried my best to be patient and calm the entire time. &nbsp;I worked my hardest on that drawing; I wanted to win so much. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t win. &nbsp;I was so angry and hurt that I took it out on the two girls who did win by writing obscenities on the bathroom stall wall in permanent pen. &nbsp;After lunch I felt so ashamed by my actions, when everyone was talking about it, that I had my mother pick me home sick from school. &nbsp;I fessed up about it on the way home to my mother, and we told the Principal the next day. &nbsp;This experience was a failure in dealing with my anger, and it still lives with me to this day.</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I remember in high school not getting into a program to go to Germany as an exchange student. &nbsp;I was so horrified because I was afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t get to go abroad because our family didn&rsquo;t have much money and I was afraid we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford it otherwise. &nbsp;We ended up finding the money for me to take part in a program through AFS so that I could go. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t AFS, but many experiences happened to me through my host family that year that were mentally damaging. &nbsp;I always feel like this was a failure, because if I had gotten into the other program perhaps I could have been spared the grief I suffered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the end of high school my Grandmother (the only one I was connected with) was dying of lung cancer. &nbsp;The last conversation I had with her concluded with her begging me to believe in Jesus. &nbsp;I lied, and said I would. &nbsp;No matter how much I knew I didn&rsquo;t have any other choice, I will always regret lying to my grandmother. &nbsp;I feel like I betrayed her.</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">During college I found out through one of my professors that the rest of the department thought I was a flake. &nbsp;This had happened due to some miscommunication regarding a student worker position over the past summer (at least as far as I know), and I tried desperately to talk with the head of the department to smooth things over. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t really work, as I had already been judged, so thus decided not to pursue graduate school at the time. &nbsp;I remember drinking a bottle of red wine while sitting in the tub talking to my best friend over the phone, trying to process what had happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Getting a DUI (Driving under the Influence) during college felt like a massive failure at the time, but I&rsquo;m not sure how truly bad it was. &nbsp;I blew a .09 (I had had two drinks that evening). &nbsp;No one was hurt. &nbsp;Oregon has this &lsquo;Diversion&rsquo; aspect where you can supposedly wipe your one and only DUI by going through a variety of activities. &nbsp;I went through the course and would have been let go at the end for good work (being sober, etc.) but stupidly listed having a Welsh beer as celebration for ending my Medieval Welsh course. &nbsp;I ended up taking another 3 months in a women&rsquo;s &lsquo;support&rsquo; type group regarding addiction.. &nbsp;That was, honestly, one of the most enlightening things in my life. &nbsp;Despite others perhaps labeling or judging me for it now, I find that experience will make my life richer and more understanding of others for years to come.</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Losing one of my best friends, a fellow french horn player and writer, whom I miss so very much today. &nbsp;He won&rsquo;t talk to me anymore. &nbsp;I think that I will always be extremely saddened by losing that friendship, and will always regret it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I had a dog once, her name was Iza. &nbsp;I had always wanted one, and I was finally in a position to get one, raise it, and take care of it. &nbsp;My failure here was in not taking care of her enough to prevent her from getting hit by a car. &nbsp;My failure here is not having enough money to get the surgery she needed. &nbsp;I will always feel that my putting her down was a personal failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My latest, but definitely not the most extraordinary, was choosing to resign from my most recent position. &nbsp;I was definitely not going to be a happy person if I stayed. &nbsp;But, having to go through everything I did was the hardest. &nbsp;I continuously felt like a failure at that position, and it makes me sad to think of how much it truly demoralized me. &nbsp;I was a sad little lurking hulk of emoticons ready to vomit nails back at people. &nbsp;It was a failure that I didn&rsquo;t speak up sooner about how I felt I was treated. &nbsp;It was a failure I didn&rsquo;t leave earlier and save myself the pain.</span></li>
</ol><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">These are, of course, only the most important and impacting of the failures in my life. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve surely done other things, however they seem less consequential, less worthy of note. &nbsp;Each one of these items reawakens my sorrow and anguish. &nbsp;To even finish the entry I&rsquo;ve had to take a couple of breaks, so I could finish. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This has been cathartic, talking about all of this. &nbsp;However I think I must needs bake and fry away my tears (yes, the improper grammar is on purpose here), with some tasty sausage and pancakes, else I will while away my time in deep thought of the things I ought to have done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
