<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16604826948605478" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once again my thoughts are plagued by my previous place of work. I&rsquo;ve been chatting about it enough, so I&rsquo;m going to give it a nickname. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;Company X&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Every once in a while I hear more news from old co-workers. &nbsp;People just wanting to catch up, see how I&rsquo;m doing. &nbsp;Every time I hear from someone there I feel a tightening in my chest. &nbsp;I feel the tension build in my shoulders. Tears water my cheekbones and I wallow. &nbsp;Depending on my mood the tears will turn to anger, supplemented with confusion and fear. &nbsp;I am constantly fearing they were/are right, that I had no idea what I was doing. That I was bad at my job, and that I imagined being bullied. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It scares me more than I care to say. &nbsp;It immobilizes me. &nbsp;To work on this fear I decided to email someone on the bullying institutes's website, and request to be part of their study. &nbsp;Perhaps this will help me. &nbsp;Perhaps getting a chance to voice my thoughts will help. &nbsp;If it doesn&rsquo;t help me perhaps it will help the next person, or help legislation get passed. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t afford to get counseling, all I can afford right now is Physical Therapy. &nbsp;I want to be able to run again, and go biking again. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve had some severe tendinitis in my left knee, and numbness in my left calf muscle for about 4 months now.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I always have these tendrils tickling my brain, emphasizing that getting even would be fun and satisfying. &nbsp;I want them to know how they made me feel; totally unsupported, alone and frightened. &nbsp;By ignoring all of my concerns they basically said that I was a horrid employee, and that I should stop &lsquo;bitching&rsquo; and get back to work. &nbsp;That it was all my fault, I was imagining it all, and that how could I think it was my bosses fault. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I hate it that they make me feel this way. &nbsp;It makes me want to crumple up inside. &nbsp;If only I could run, or bike, or do something other than sit at home and work. &nbsp;Here I am gaining weight, sitting on my rear end because I&rsquo;m slightly immobile at 28. &nbsp;Please Physical Therapy, solve the mysteries that are my leg pain before my insurance runs out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Current Day Update: </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I can run and walk again, I can kind of bike. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been helping tremendously, however I&rsquo;m still having issues coping. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m finding help and healing through creating my lame-a%# comics and other graphics. &nbsp;However, I did receive an email from the bullying institute that I cannot be part of their study until a year after I stopped working at the place in question. &nbsp;It makes sense for their study, but does prevent me from having that outlet. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The worst part of all of this, is that I constantly assume that all my friends and family agree with my old employers, but don&rsquo;t say anything because it&rsquo;s not appropriate. &nbsp;That they think I was just too weak, and too easily felt offended by the criticism. &nbsp;That I did imagine the entire episode, when I felt my employment was threatened. &nbsp;That fear is something that rolls along my brain-walls constantly. &nbsp;Then comes the depression and self-hatred again. &nbsp;Raining from buckets and plaster chunks, sometimes it seeps and other times it knocks me off balance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
