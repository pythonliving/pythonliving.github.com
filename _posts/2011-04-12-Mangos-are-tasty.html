<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3883966456633061" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Every day that I can&rsquo;t truly work I feel this dread. &nbsp;This feeling that I&rsquo;m not doing enough. &nbsp;Lately it&rsquo;s been pretty pervasive, this feeling of dread. &nbsp;Previous to the beginning of my unemployment (i.e. self employment) I had joined a planning committee for a local Homeless Connect Event. &nbsp;The event was this past Friday, so this past week was making sure all plans were finalized. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been eating up a lot of my time, as I was the person gathering many of the food donations. &nbsp;It seems that food donations are normally given late, as many people who donate food do so just prior to the event to prevent spoilage. &nbsp;This meant lots of phone calls and running around for me. &nbsp;Despite all the event turned out well, and I&rsquo;m now back to my usual daily toils.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Which means I&rsquo;m hit stark in the face with the fact that I haven&rsquo;t touched the MIT course or readings for a couple of days. &nbsp;I also haven&rsquo;t played or worked on many things for work since Wednesday before the event. &nbsp;It will be nice to start feeling &lsquo;work-related&rsquo; productive again.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I received another email from an old co-worker. &nbsp;Just hearing from someone from my old place of work makes me depressed. &nbsp;Actually, just seeing a facebook profile of one of my old coworkers makes me upset. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s amazing just how much my self esteem was affected by it all. &nbsp;Never doubt just how much your work life can affect your overall mood. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This email emphasized my need to be self employed. &nbsp;Each time I think about getting a 9-5 job, I get a little panicky. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so scared of having to work for someone, to have someone make me feel that way again. &nbsp;So powerless, and so incredibly hopeless. &nbsp;After reading research from the bullying institute, it talked about how most people in such situations never get out with anything positive. &nbsp;Most people simply leave, without ever filing a formal complaint. &nbsp;For those who file a complaint, most never see something positive come out of it. &nbsp;So I knew that it was coming when I started down the road, I just also knew that it wasn&rsquo;t going to get any better unless I tried something. &nbsp;I hope that either self-employment works, or I eventually find a job for someone who enjoys my go-get&rsquo;em attitude and tenacity. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For anyone else who has suffered through office bullying my heart goes out to you. &nbsp;It is very painful and often-times a humiliating experience. &nbsp;Do your best to not let them get to you. If you start to believe them, it will take you that much longer to find yourself again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
