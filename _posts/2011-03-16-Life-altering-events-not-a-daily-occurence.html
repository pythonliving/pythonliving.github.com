<p id="internal-source-marker_0.383523061638698" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was my last day. &nbsp;It was Tuesday. &nbsp;I had turned in my two week notice the day before. &nbsp;I walked to work, excited at my upcoming prospects, and thinking about the work I needed to collect and organize for my soon to be ex-employers. &nbsp;I wanted to make sure to leave them in the best situation possible, considering I was leaving soon. &nbsp;I had lots to do, and was sitting in a location that was much healthier for me. &nbsp;It was not that I had been sitting somewhere with mold, or tight quarters that made me hit my shins every time I turned around. &nbsp;I had been sitting for most of my 9 months, in the same office with my direct supervisor. &nbsp;The person who I had recently submitted a complaint of harassment against. &nbsp;I was moved to a different area. &nbsp;They conducted an investigation. &nbsp;At the end I was given the verdict. &nbsp;It was something along the lines of: There is no evidence proving that these events occurred.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But I digress. &nbsp;It was my last day. &nbsp;I arrive at work, go next door to the coffee shop and grab my coffee. &nbsp;Back at my desk I start snacking on my two pieces of mozzarella string cheese, sip my coffee, and get to work reviewing emails. &nbsp;Chatter in this new area I&rsquo;m in is positive, friendly, and inviting. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m feeling great, and partially sad that I will not get a chance to work with such great people in the future. &nbsp;I have a meeting this morning, reviewing my work and making sure everyone is up to speed on the projects I&rsquo;ve been working on. &nbsp;My supervisor is incredibly positive, and impressed with my work. &nbsp;While showing all the work I&rsquo;ve put in, I end up getting complimented so much I could almost imagine that what&rsquo;s happened over the past month was a dream. &nbsp;I go to lunch, and return. &nbsp;Sitting at my computer getting started again I am called over by HR to discuss, what I thought, was the general practices of employees leaving this particular organization.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was handed a piece of paperwork indicating that I was paid in full, and could now stop working immediately. &nbsp;I was told, that I had been placed on administrative leave for the remainder of my two weeks. &nbsp;&ldquo;We will help you collect your things and you can go...</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">now</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">,&rdquo; &nbsp;they say. &nbsp;A bit flustered but under control I stand up, grab my last paycheck, and start toward my temporary location in the other building. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Suffice it to say I grabbed my things, called my boyfriend to come pick me up, and left. &nbsp;All the while half of my coworkers were sitting there with shocked and sad faces watching as I collected my things. &nbsp;Despite the 9 months of stress that I had been enduring, and what I thought was bullying from my direct supervisor, while walking away I could not stop laughing.</span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">WHO DOES THAT???</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They knew that I was going to be leaving, as I had already turned in my two week notice. &nbsp;So why the need to usher me out the door even faster? &nbsp;Not only ushering me out, but paying me for my time to boot. &nbsp;Why would you do something like that? &nbsp;I mean, if I was someone else, someone who came in with bad intentions, it might be more realistic. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m an intelligent person who, for one reason or another, started too low on the totem pole. &nbsp;I tend to intimidate some people in the places I work. &nbsp;I get too much done too fast. </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">During my time at this job I was continuously criticized for not meeting expectations in my workplace. &nbsp;I was placed on two separate forms of &lsquo;improvement plans&rsquo; or &lsquo;probation&rsquo;. &nbsp;After some rough self reflection it still didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always excelled in school and I&rsquo;ve been given lots of positive feedback from my previous employers about my quality of work and the expediency in which I complete my tasks. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always been appreciated as a person who gets things done. &nbsp;A person who works hard, and does a good job. &nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Why would they have put me on administrative leave? &nbsp;As far as I know it is not corporate policy to do so. &nbsp;Why not fire me if they thought I was a poor employee? &nbsp;That and millions of other questions were going through my head. &nbsp;They still are. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m now faced with being unemployed in this down economy, in a state that has one of the highest unemployment rates. &nbsp;Why am I telling you all this? &nbsp;Why does anyone care? &nbsp;Because I feel I&rsquo;m like many young Americans out there, thrust into unemployment but still desperately wanting to make something of myself. &nbsp;</span></p>
