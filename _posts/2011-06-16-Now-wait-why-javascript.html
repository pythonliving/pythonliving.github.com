<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4693866651505232" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After my minimal review of Javascript so far, I&rsquo;ve already learned several important aspects. &nbsp;Mainly that if someone learned how to use Javascript then only used the W3schools tutorial to learn the rest, they would be sorely missing part of the point. &nbsp;Javascript, while being a breakdown of the more intense programming languages, is still a programming language. &nbsp;It still harnesses some of the same power structures in order to process the information. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For example, in the W3schools Javascript tutorial, they don&rsquo;t explain </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">why</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> to make sure to use quotes around words. &nbsp;The reason being because it&rsquo;s a string, or something that is not to be treated as a number in any way. &nbsp;But W3schools doesn&rsquo;t want to get into those specifics, which is understandable. &nbsp;However I could see simple aspects, such as that, which could create serious problems for those learning how to use Javascript who don&rsquo;t understand that tiny detail. &nbsp;It might make debugging in Javascript that much more difficult. &nbsp;Not to mention that as far as I can tell Javascript has no actual debugging functions within the language, the website either does what you want or not. &nbsp;Which that... brings up another total set of problems.</span><br /><br /></div>
