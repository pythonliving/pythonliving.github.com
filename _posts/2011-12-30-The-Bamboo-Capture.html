<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.8463943402748555"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As I mentioned earlier in the week, Robey purchased me a</span><a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Bamboo/BambooTablets/BambooCapture.aspx"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bamboo Capture</span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;What this is, is a little flat tablet shaped device with a stylus. &nbsp;It allows you to use the stylus as you would a mouse, for either simple movements or for more detailed and focused artwork. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t consider myself able when it comes to drawing. &nbsp;In all actuality I&rsquo;m horrible. &nbsp;So if this makes me a more capable artist, well hell. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think you could get a better recommendation than that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.8463943402748555" style="background-color: transparent;"><img class="posterous_plugin_object posterous_plugin_object_image" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-30/AuwGtdlhhoBCgznAeAvstJnejIrwJnfegyzhIClxaIIpahAwkonHicbsBErE/Wacom-Bamboo-Capture-Pen-Tablet.jpg.thumb100.jpg?content_part=pFxwqvslddsyqEAGmlex" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></strong><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As you can see from the image you have a rectangular tablet, with buttons on the left. &nbsp;Those buttons act as the button on your mouse, however your stylus also has a toggle button along where your thumb rests. &nbsp;The toggle button allows for easy click and drag when necessary. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The software that comes with the device has this neat little option for handwriting recognition. &nbsp;Unfortunately I&rsquo;m still not used to it enough to finish going though the identification process. &nbsp;When using my Capture my handwriting looks like a 7 year old&rsquo;s. &nbsp;This is mostly due to the fact that I learned to write always resting the side of my hand while using my fore finger and thumb for most of the pressure on the pencil. &nbsp;As part of awesomeness of this technology is that the pad is ultra sensitive to pressure, the side of my hand totally messes with the recognition on the pad. &nbsp;You can simply hold the stylus above the pad, but that is still an unnatural feeling for me. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve thought about trying it out with gaming. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m a little worried however that I&rsquo;m so used to mouse/keyboard combinations that the change would be quite a bit of work. &nbsp;BUT, I&rsquo;m still going to try it. &nbsp;I think it might be interesting to see how it works using a pen to play a little Tower Defense.</span><br /></strong></div>
