<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Learning how to code javascript (and understand it&rsquo;s inter-connectivity with HTML for pulling in user input) has been something else. &nbsp;First off I began this exercise by learning how to use a new text-editor, Vim. &nbsp;Next I also had to start learning how to use my programming knowledge and match it up with a new language. &nbsp;Previously I had been reading up about javascript on W3schools, and had gotten through most of the basics. &nbsp;Just last week I started learning a bit of javascript and jQuery to add some bits to our website. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That was definitely not enough to have me sufficiently prepared for the symbol shock I later experienced.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;These past 4 days have been filled with consistent questions and checking for syntax errors. &nbsp;In all honesty I don&rsquo;t know why someone felt it was necessary to make semicolons such an integral part of this language. &nbsp;Sometimes it just makes the screen feel ridiculously busy. &nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s just me as I&rsquo;ve only really learned python at this point. &nbsp;Python doesn&rsquo;t have some of these additional curly bracket/semicolon requirements that are a necessary part of javascript. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I think one of the more difficult parts of javascript so far is simply learning the different terminologies to use when I want to do certain things I would have done in Python. &nbsp;Such as using </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">console.log()</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> instead of </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">print</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;Or learning how to take in information from the HTML and how to alter it in the javascript(JS). &nbsp;Learning when to create firm CSS or when to not create any and just create a div that you alter in the JS. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So yes, plenty of new things to spark my brain into activity. &nbsp;Today I&rsquo;m hoping to finish creating the particles that come into existence when a ship is blown up from a correct answer, and also to create the bombs that hit them. &nbsp;That means some additional graphical creation, but that&rsquo;s just play work at this point. &nbsp;Despite working pretty consistently to learn as much as I can and finish this project by my deadline, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m working. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I already feel like I&rsquo;m on vacation, because what I&rsquo;m doing creates so many instances of &lsquo;woo I just made it do that&rsquo; excitement.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;I guess this is what finding your dream job is like. &nbsp;Never knew I would find it in programming. &nbsp;Glad I never gave up on learning new things. &nbsp;:)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: A little Thanksgiving reflection regarding social skill acquisition </span></div>
