<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5457408241927624"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The best thing you can do in life is understand that judgement happens. &nbsp;Worrying about when and if it happens shouldn&rsquo;t be on your mind. &nbsp;You should simply recognize it as a fact, and then get back to whatever it was you were doing.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Granted, me saying this doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m the best at implementing it.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;In all honesty I have more problems than the average bear in the worry department. &nbsp;I worry all the time about how my interactions will affect others, or what I can do to make things better if they go awry. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The sheer amount of how much I worry is so large, I am already fairly certain it means I am going to die younger than I should. &nbsp;I do my best to mitigate it, but it fairly often feels like a losing battle.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How do I let go of the worry that people are going to judge me?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;The best thing I&rsquo;ve learned, is simply to nip the problem in the bud </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">by doing something about it.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Then if I feel I&rsquo;ve addressed the expected judgement I&rsquo;m concerned about, if they still respond negatively it doesn&rsquo;t get to me. &nbsp;If anything I just feel sorry for the person not realizing I&rsquo;m doing my best to work with them.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How do you nip it in the bud? &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re concerned that someone is going to judge you for something silly, and perhaps chat about thus stuffs with other people, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">simply communicate with them about it. &nbsp;Notice I don&rsquo;t say confront them.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Confrontation is probably the best way to shut someone up and make them not listen to what you&rsquo;re saying. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Find a way to &lsquo;suggest&rsquo; to them that they may not be correct in their opinion about you.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re concerned someone may not want to be your friend that you would enjoy a friendship with, send them a facebook message or quick email saying that you would enjoy their company at such and such an event. &nbsp;Do it in a very laid back way, emphasizing that if you don&rsquo;t see them it will be sad but that you hope to chat with them in the future. &nbsp;Making it an email or facebook message, versus a tweet, makes it more personal. &nbsp;It makes the person feel that you take them seriously, that you are interested in getting to know them better. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lastly </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">you have to be honest about all of this. &nbsp;If you are disingenuous about any of it, it will shine through.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;If it really matters to you the other person will know. &nbsp;</span></strong></div>
