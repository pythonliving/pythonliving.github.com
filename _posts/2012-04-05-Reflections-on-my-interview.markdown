Rehashing on everything that happened for 90 minutes.  Deliberatly remembering all the things that made me quit my previous job.  Explaining them to someone else.  

I thought that this experience was going to be severely painful.  I expected to cry.  I didn't. 

I didn't feel crazy for reacting the way I did.  Discussing what happened and how I reacted, **I** realized just how much I was trying to make the whole thing work.  It wasn't just me repeating what other people said.  "Yes, I know.  Yes, I'm not crazy..."  On and on my list goes of all the things that I still felt were my fault.

Now I know that I wasn't crazy.  Now I know that it was real, and not just something I made up in my head.  It's so incredibly empowering.  It's insane the effect that kind of thing has on your confidence.  It's a good sign.
