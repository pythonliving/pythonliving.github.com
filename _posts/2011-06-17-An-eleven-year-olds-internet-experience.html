<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.11078886990435421" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the new aspects of modern culture is the quick addition of technology to society. &nbsp;In previous times the additions were simply not as often seen by the common man. &nbsp;More often than not, those additions did not add unlimited communication/connectivity for the average Joe to the world. &nbsp;Now we have blogs, YouTube, and forums. &nbsp;With such easily accessible means to make yourself look stupid, so many more people are doing that. &nbsp;Sometimes they mean to, but sometimes they are too young to have any clue as to what their actions might do. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So many children know easily how to lie around the various age restrictions online, and if their parents don&rsquo;t know enough about computers, they would have no idea how to stop them. &nbsp;This is similar to the situation with my family. &nbsp;My niece&rsquo;s and nephew&rsquo;s parents have many more things going on in their life and don&rsquo;t have much time to sit and learn how to understand all these different things about the games their kids play. &nbsp;But the kids do, and they are learning like crazy. &nbsp;Should they be prevented from even accessing the Web, or should they be allowed to because it&rsquo;s understood how much it will be a part of society. &nbsp;An &ldquo;earlier they start, the better&rdquo; mentality if you will?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They are learning to use technologies before they are old enough to really understand the implications of their actions, and they really have no one to prevent them. &nbsp;My nephew is starting middle school next year, and I wonder how his generation will view this in the future? &nbsp;Will they just learn to laugh it off or are current media practices to make sure that such things don&rsquo;t happen, at least for a while. &nbsp;You do something stupid, it stays with you forever, especially if it&rsquo;s online. &nbsp;The paranoia that comes along with all of this explains why so many people honestly don&rsquo;t bother with the Web. &nbsp;Who wants to be judged by millions of faceless names? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
