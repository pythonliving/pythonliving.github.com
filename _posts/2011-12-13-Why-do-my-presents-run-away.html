<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8257712998893112" style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous how the holidays sneak up on you. &nbsp;I realized today that even though I have most of my holiday </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">shopping</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> done, most of my holiday </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">projects</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> are far from done. &nbsp;This means that on top of getting all the work related items I need to get done finished, I also have a fair amount of textile craftery to do. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Robey and I have started to run a mile everyday. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fantastic. &nbsp;We usually use it as a midday break. &nbsp;After working about 4 hours in the morning we go and run, take a shower, and then get back to work for a while. &nbsp;I really like it. &nbsp;Getting out running while it&rsquo;s sunny out, and as it&rsquo;s Oregon at the very least we&rsquo;re getting outside. &nbsp;Luckily we haven&rsquo;t had any issues with running in the rain, only the cold. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Working slowly on my game. &nbsp;Today I was supposed to talk about how creating a pause function is really annoying more difficult than it should be, but that will have to wait for tomorrow. &nbsp;Also, to note, it is now officially 12 days till Christmas. &nbsp;12 days. &nbsp;Time......to......freak.....out.</span></div>
