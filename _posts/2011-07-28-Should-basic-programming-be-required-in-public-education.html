<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.152863533468917" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Every day I am more and more convinced of the different social class that exists when it comes to programmers. &nbsp;Anyone who has the time and inclination to become a programmer (most of the time), has been presented with a life situation that allows them the time and concentration necessary to learn programming. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the side aspects that comes along with being a programmer seems to include the ability to divide processes into more easily completed chunks. &nbsp;This ability is extremely valuable in almost all professions. &nbsp;This leads me to believe, especially with the growth and dependency on technology, that basic programming should be a minimal requirement in highschool.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What would teaching basic programming and computer education bring to public high school education? &nbsp;Increased problem solving ability. &nbsp;I believe it would significantly increase the ability for many students, to interpret and solve a variety of problems from mathematics to social ones. &nbsp;Increased computer education would increase the base knowledge of our population and lessen the amount of stress on IT departments. &nbsp;I also think it&rsquo;s necessary that the next generations are taught the basics of online safety. &nbsp;Not simply viruses, but also on the effects from online social interactions. &nbsp;In turn this could help to further protect our populations from scams of a variety of natures, and simply provide some basic understanding of what to watch out for. &nbsp;I think that if this could be done effectively it would highly benefit our society as it grows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
