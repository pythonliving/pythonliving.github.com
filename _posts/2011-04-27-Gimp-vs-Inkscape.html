<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.046131513081490993" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve found stark differences between Inkscape and Gimp, the two different graphics editing programs that I&rsquo;m learning. &nbsp;First off Gimp is more pixel focused, and therefore more helpful in adjusting photographs. &nbsp;Inkscape is for vector graphics, and is better in terms of scaling (going from an image 128 by 128 pixels, to 500 by 500, back down, and so on). &nbsp;Therefore for shapes and vectors, it&rsquo;s the preferred open-source option from what I can tell. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Gimp, as I&rsquo;ve read, has been around for years. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve personally found it&rsquo;s easier to begin using without tutorials, in comparison with Inkscape. &nbsp;This is partially due to the similarity in organization. &nbsp;For someone who was used to MS Paint, I&rsquo;ve found that Gimp seems to organize their different alteration items in the same manner. &nbsp;Therefore, if you don&rsquo;t want to read tutorials, Gimp would be the program to start with. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I emphasize this</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> as I&rsquo;ve found the Gimp tutorials to be difficult to follow. &nbsp;This particular comment is specific to the tutorials on their website. &nbsp;Those tutorials make assumptions on where different commands are, and what different things do, assumptions in knowledge types that I don&rsquo;t currently possess. &nbsp;It made me do a lot of head scratching, at one point making me worried I had lice... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Luckily that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now for the other program, Inkscape. &nbsp;Honestly, for those who like quick key combos on the keyboard, Inkscape tutorials are amazing. &nbsp;They list it all out along with giving you tons of great simple ways to make your work easier to do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s well put together, and much easier to follow. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t have as many pre-created filters as Gimp however, and that is kinda a bummer. &nbsp;Well, at least at first. &nbsp;I am quickly falling in love with Inkscape and would recommend it to anyone who wants an open source program to use in computer graphics creation. &nbsp;However the best combination is using both. &nbsp;Start with creating your image in Inkscape, export it to a .png, and then edit it further if needed (along with applying various pre-made filters) in Gimp. &nbsp;Gimp has many more options when it comes to exporting and saving in various file types, which is why I tend to do final editing within it. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One last note. &nbsp;These were the two main open source graphics editing programs that I&rsquo;ve found. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m always looking for new open source graphics editing programs, as I find it simply intriguing. &nbsp;Please let me know if you&rsquo;re aware of any out there I can take a look at. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
