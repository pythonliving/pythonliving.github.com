<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8207679674960673" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I think about getting a job a lot lately. &nbsp;I sit and stare at Craigslist ads and realize I&rsquo;ve kind of forgotten how to do it. &nbsp;Where to go, what to do. &nbsp;Most of it&rsquo;s intentional. &nbsp;I hate the idea of another company with total control over me, regulating my every word, with every second thought being full of fear that I am simply not capable or creative enough to be self sustaining. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a complicated and full world. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What have I to offer? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Then my brain-void fills with thoughts of self loathing and ineptitude. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid&rdquo; is everywhere I look, in everything I do. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I start to think about looking for jobs again. &nbsp;I start to think about getting simple jobs because, perhaps, I just need to make ends meet for a little while. &nbsp;Then I think about running into the people who hurt me so much at my last job, and I become afraid again. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t live in the biggest of towns, so running into them is bound to happen. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s more likely if I were to work in a field of service, something more basic where the public sees you more. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve just started laughing again, laughing at full force. &nbsp;As I am in love with my own happiness, the idea of having to return to something that would stifle this is horrifying. &nbsp;However in all honesty it&rsquo;s not there everyday, this free laughter. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s there some days, and then gone others, but it&rsquo;s still there sometimes. &nbsp;I see it, and can feel it and experience it again. &nbsp;The idea of giving that up...</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Then I start reworking things that happened and I have trouble sleeping again. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t fall asleep because all I do is play reruns of all the things I regret in my own head. &nbsp;I want to be able to push pass this and be able to live life again without regret. &nbsp;How do you learn to live without regret, ever? &nbsp;How do you learn to live and not fall asleep every night in angst and pain because you can&rsquo;t help but relive it all over again as you crash?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
