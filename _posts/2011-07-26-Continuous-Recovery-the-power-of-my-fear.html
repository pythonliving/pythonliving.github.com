<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8026728075928986" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I&rsquo;m about to fall asleep I feel that nagging self doubt. &nbsp;That questioning about what happened. &nbsp;I think about whether I could have done anything else and I ask myself if I&rsquo;m a good person or not. &nbsp;I ask if I tried my hardest, if I&rsquo;m smart enough or a good enough worker. &nbsp;I ask myself why it happened to me. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Then the fear starts to creep back. &nbsp;My recognition that the lack of unemployment support confirmed that the &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; believe my former employer. But then I have to stop myself. &nbsp;I have to remind myself that it happened to me. That she treated me like that, and that I did my best and worked my hardest to do the job. &nbsp;I did my best while still choosing to think that I might have been at fault. &nbsp;I did my best to work on both sides, standing up for myself and understanding I might be wrong about the whole thing. &nbsp;Despite everything, and how far I&rsquo;ve come, I still find myself angry and hurt. &nbsp;I still find myself wishing I could do something to prove them wrong. &nbsp;To not allow them to have the power they have over me to exist anymore. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m so sick of not believing in myself. I&rsquo;m so sick of even thinking about it. &nbsp;Some days I can imagine it never happened. &nbsp;But lately I find myself seeing more and more of my former coworkers around town. In the beginning each time it happened I would almost have a mini panic attack. My heart would beat painfully, and I would start breathing very fast. &nbsp;Now my reaction has calmed down, but each interaction still unsettles me; the thought of that place still angers me. &nbsp;They still have that temporary power over me and I hate them all for it. Then I get angry again. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve changed my life entirely. I thought I was finally starting to focus on what I wanted to do professionally before, and now I feel like I could never work in that field again. &nbsp;One of the base reasons being for fear of having to talk to those people who hurt me so much.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now I feel like a mixed metaphor. &nbsp;What a curve ball I&rsquo;ve been dealt.</span></div>
