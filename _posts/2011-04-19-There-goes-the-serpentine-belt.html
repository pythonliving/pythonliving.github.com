<p id="internal-source-marker_0.7668102425523102" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This past weekend was packed full of visiting family and friends. &nbsp;It was a weekend right after a large event happened, that I helped to plan. &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t been able to work for about 3 to 4 days, and I was starting to go bonkers. &nbsp;That weekend at his parents we visited Costco and picked up some goodies, and we also ended up watching that &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; movie. &nbsp;I worked on some blogging things, Robey helped his dad get the squirrels out of the garage roof area,. &nbsp;Seems like the squirrels were chewing on electrical wires, and his dad was worried about them starting a fire. &nbsp;All in all, a productive weekend. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We were late heading home Monday morning from Robey&rsquo;s folks and I was really antsy. &nbsp;I wanted to get home and start getting some work done. &nbsp;The more time it took, the more I fidgeted and the more grumpy I became. &nbsp;I would pack things as soon as they were ready, not really allowing Robey to pack anything away. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t take long, and everything was packed in the car. &nbsp;After a bit of chatting we said our goodbyes. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Excited for my soon to be tasted Dutch Bros I revved up the car, and started heading out of the driveway. &nbsp;As I started driving I noticed that the wheel wasn&rsquo;t turning at all, and it took serious strength to move it. &nbsp;Thinking at first that the power steering was shot, I stopped the car, gave it a second, and then moved forward again to check. &nbsp;The wheel still wasn&rsquo;t budging. &nbsp;Robey and I traded seats, and he gave it a go. &nbsp;No difference. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At this point I&rsquo;m starting to crack. &nbsp;I had wanted to get back home and get started on work but it was starting to look like it wouldn&rsquo;t happen today. &nbsp;Robey calls his father right away, as he had changed the tires for us over the weekend. &nbsp;His dad decided to come straight home to check it out for us. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s about 30 minutes from their house, so we go inside to wait for him. &nbsp;At this point Robey and I start fighting. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m all stressed, wanting to get work done, and Robey&rsquo;s stressed, wanting to help his parents and get work done. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re both just ready to head out, and subsequently steam is let off in not the most appropriate of places. &nbsp;Our argument eventually winds down as I calm down a bit and we started figuring things out. &nbsp;This happened about the same time his father gets back home, and starts working on the car. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As we head out to check in on the &lsquo;goings on&rsquo;, his father speaks up. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think I know what your problem is,&rdquo; he chuckles and walks us over to the car, oblivious to our having argued the past 30 minutes. &nbsp;He lifted the hood and we peered in. &nbsp;It seems the squirrels who had been in love with electrical wire, decided to make a new home of our car engine. &nbsp;They had ripped up a good portion of the hood lining to create a nest, and then settled in for a nap. &nbsp;When I started up the car, the squirrel had been sleeping right next to one of the belts. &nbsp;Suffice it to say, it ended up getting caught in the belt, and the engine area was a &lsquo;mess&rsquo;. &nbsp;It seems that fast moving items can spread bits of things quite a ways within an enclosed area. &nbsp;</span></p>
