<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Earlier this week I&rsquo;ve been fair stressed out. &nbsp;Most days it&rsquo;s been a question of finding a way to get things done while still making my emotional self not implode. &nbsp;Sometimes when I look back at my entries and realize just how many of them are about stress, I ask myself, how do I get </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">anything</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> done?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Last night, thankfully, I found one of my old yoga videos I would follow during college. &nbsp;There are &nbsp;five different segments throughout the day, with the beginning and ending ones focusing on waking up and getting you to sleep. &nbsp;The last one for the end of the day is basically a yoga relaxation technique. &nbsp;I forgot how well I can respond to those, because I always feel a bit....drugged afterwards. &nbsp;It was good medicine that the doctor ordered.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Not just that, but this morning I awoke with the sun shining, and did more yoga. &nbsp;Warm and liquid like I start the day. &nbsp;Now I feel like more creation-work, however I need to get more work-work done. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve started a new job recently, translating German for local science startup company. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only part time, and it gives me a chance to work with languages again. &nbsp;It does also, however, remind me that I&rsquo;m in a &lsquo;work&rsquo; environment again. &nbsp;Work politics and all the other aspects of being employed by someone are there again. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At first I was apprehensive, considering my most recent experiences working for someone else. &nbsp;I am still apprehensive. &nbsp;Every once in a while I will emotionally react to an incident, and it will be much stronger than I anticipated. &nbsp;Then, for a while, it will heavily affect my ability to work and my ability to reason. &nbsp;The issue with this is that there has been nothing to really instigate these feelings. &nbsp;All the things that have happened thus far are the normal interactions of being employed by someone. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I knew that once I started working somewhere again these feelings and stressors would show up. &nbsp;The thoughts and feelings that I&rsquo;ve been fighting this past half-year, the emotional well being I created, is now being pressured. &nbsp;Once again I am faced with one of the constant pains in my chest, the fear that others will not trust me.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: Fearing a lack of trust, and why it rules my life.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span></div>
