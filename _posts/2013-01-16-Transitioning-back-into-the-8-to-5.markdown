As like with many vacations, getting back into the swing of things afterwards can almost rid you of all your stored up relaxation.  On top of that, so much time away from your regular life gives you lots of time to reflect and think about what's really important to you.  

It makes you think about where you're going and what you want.  Celebrating New Year's and thinking about your resolutions at the same time?  That's double duty mind games.

It's taken me a bit to get back into coding and working on the business after my normal 8 to 5.  Just getting through the work day, then moving on towards...rock climbing, soccer or crocheting is a stretch.  Half the time all I want to do is sleep.

I miss the time when I could devote a good portion of my day to coding, blog entry writing, and learning about building a business.  Your own business can be so exciting as you make it happen.  The ownership you get from that experience charges you and fulfills you in ways a normal employee based experience never can.

But for now I'll keep focusing on trying to get what I can done...trying to squeeze a little bit of programming each day.  Most of all, I'll do my best to take it easy and not let all the projects and things I want to get done get to me.  I'll see what I can to to chill, even when life or work stresses me out.
