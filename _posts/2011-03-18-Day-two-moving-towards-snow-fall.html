<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2512874791864306" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Oh day two of unemployment, how lack luster you were. &nbsp;I spent the day meeting up with ex-coworkers and my mother, doing dishes and organizing sales data for our applications. &nbsp;Working on a couple of personal projects, like crocheting house socks (the design dating from the seventies) and playing in the snow. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Yes it snowed.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Amazingly enough I am unemployed on a day where everyone else except my former place of employment, has off, because we had 4 inches of snow. &nbsp;It may not be much to you, but in the Willamette Valley 4 inches means several years worth of snow related accident horror stories. &nbsp;It feels odd to be unemployed on one of the few days where we actually have snow. &nbsp;I started making a snowman, and then realized that I would rather see the snow on the ground than roll up the snow. &nbsp;That thought, though, was quickly belayed by a snow ball fight with my boyfriend. &nbsp;At the end of it I was laughing. &nbsp;I felt a release, the laughter made my whole body glow. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I like the snow. &nbsp;I especially like it on castles and Stavkirke (Norwegian Stave Churches). It reminds me of the stories I read as an undergrad. &nbsp;During my &lsquo;Bachelor&rsquo;s training&rsquo; I did lots of things. &nbsp;I joined the marching band, dated a homeless man (among other with-home men), gave hemoglobin for money, ate at a stone soup, got a DUI, and watched my family start to separate and grow apart. &nbsp;I also did other things, things not so dismal or dreary. &nbsp;I lived in Norway for half a year, studied 5 different languages (alive and dead), sang in a gospel choir, volunteered for a community garden and climbed a mountain. &nbsp;I experienced life as best I could. &nbsp;As I graduated in 2006 I had little to say, I just wanted to &ldquo;Go to Colorado and rock climb&rdquo;. &nbsp;Not much to that really. &nbsp;I wanted to hike the Appalachian trail toe to head, and I wanted to camp in the rain. &nbsp;I wanted to get away. &nbsp;I wanted to stop listening to what was required of me and do something that would revitalize my soul. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now I&rsquo;m back in my home town. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve quit my job and by choice am self-employed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m injured and unable to play the sport I love, soccer. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m low on self esteem and I&rsquo;ve got about 5 months of rent in the bank. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s time to apply for food stamps, along with looking into unemployment. &nbsp;This situation is primed for a long bout of deep depression with a side of 20 pounds weight gain (as long as the food stamps pull through). &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Today the people in my life are my inspiration. &nbsp;They possess rich souls, and they share laughter and love with me continuously. &nbsp;My neighbors, my family, my friends, and my beloved. &nbsp;I wish to share more of my life with them. &nbsp;So now I have some work to do. &nbsp;I need to find a way to make rent payments, and get food on the table. &nbsp;And this time I want to do it on my own terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
