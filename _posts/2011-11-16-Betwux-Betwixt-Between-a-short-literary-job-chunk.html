<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6816476851236075" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Betwux two worlds is a sea of foam. &nbsp;A place where the warm fluffy ocean tickles your hips and calves. &nbsp;The sun is both rising and setting, whilst it warms your back with midday strength. &nbsp;The sky is a rich mixture of yellows and pinks and blues. &nbsp;You are awake and yet asleep. &nbsp;Floating on foam that feels like oil yet with a fresh sting like arctic water. &nbsp;Scents of a salty sweet sea, you relax in a Candy-Land. &nbsp;One of dreams and passions enriched with the fat of youth. &nbsp;Yellow brick pathways towards growth and adventure, to fanciful places and far-out landscapes. &nbsp;British Taxi&rsquo;s take you from country cottage to Highland manor. &nbsp;Tropical birds swoop into your Siberian menagerie, delighting upon boiled peanuts and flower petals. &nbsp;Your hound-dogs transport you on hunts as your horses chase your prey. &nbsp;Through a glass flask and back again out the other side. &nbsp;Traveling midst the depths of thought and time. &nbsp;Waves propel you forwards and Betwux.</span></div>
