<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5800546833779663"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Last night I started working on my game again. &nbsp;It felt good to start looking at the code and figuring out what I was doing where. &nbsp;Even better, is that </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I started to organize my code</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while. &nbsp;I am still working on my &lsquo;using space bar as a pause button&rsquo;, but until I can more easily read through my code and know what&rsquo;s happening I think that any further progress is going to be difficult.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At least, for me. &nbsp;I have a good idea of most of what&rsquo;s in my js file (javascript file), but sometimes recognizing what interacts with what appropriately enough to know how to alter things. &nbsp;Well, yes, that is the difficult part. &nbsp;Robey discussed a normal practice, that if you can&rsquo;t see an entire function on your screen, then it&rsquo;s too big. &nbsp;That means you need to subdivide, and separate out the parts into smaller functions. &nbsp;That had happened with my </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">tick()</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> function. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In case you&rsquo;ve forgotten, my </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">tick()</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> function is the one that runs most of the aspects of the game. &nbsp;it interprets time as it progresses throughout the game, and makes sure the the appropriate checks occur when they should. &nbsp;Basically, it&rsquo;s the type of function that can normally get really big anyways. &nbsp;It was high time I went and chopped it up. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once I had reorganized my code I had a much better idea of what was going on. &nbsp;Unfortunately it&rsquo;s been long enough that parts of it are still a mystery, so I&rsquo;m going to need to simply go back over everything. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Like with any organization, making sure that similar things are in the same place makes it easier overall</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the things I&rsquo;ve run into now, though, is how much more I want to know. &nbsp;How much more I want to understand. &nbsp;Problem is, ya gotta eat, and right now I&rsquo;m paying off loans and credit cards with the money I&rsquo;m earning from translation, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">so translation is always...first priority</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I miss the day when I was able to focus purely on FlamingLunchbox. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Oddly enough, I didn&rsquo;t actually make my first game until after I started my translation job. &nbsp;Did I need that stability, or more like, did I need the safety of a job that was sure to pay before I could feel able to devote time elsewhere?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;It would be sad to say if that&rsquo;s the case. &nbsp;For some reason it makes me feel not quite devoted enough. &nbsp;But I guess, that&rsquo;s kinda the way it goes until you feel like you can actually do something without asking a bazillion questions. &nbsp;You need a level of confidence in what you&rsquo;re doing, before you can start to feel able to do it on your own. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /></strong></div>
