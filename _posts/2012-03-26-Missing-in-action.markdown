It seems I am still fighting panic attacks and depression.  This morning I awoke at 9am ready to start the day, but decided to hit the snooze button for 30 minutes.  I later woke up at noon.  At that point I proceeded to hang out in bed for a while, dreading the day, and finally got out to eat and watch some TV.  After a couple of episodes of DS9 I decided to take a bath.  That's when my panic attack started to set it.  The heat overwhelmed me for a bit, so I only stayed in the bath for about 10 minutes.  Then I got out, put on some clothes and decided to go do some errands.  

After dropping off some paper work downtown and turning some recycling in at the local Co-op I grabbed a cup of coffee and started driving.  I didn't care where I went I just needed to clear my head.  So I drove.  Taking random turns around the countryside between Corvallis and Albany I just drifted and sang to random oldies songs on the radio.  

I finally stopped at a local Gardening shop called Garlands, bought a couple of items, and left again.  Then I kept driving around, grabbed some new pillows and headed home.  I had finally calmed down at that point, but up until then I was afraid to turn around.  The panic was located at home, where I hadn't been getting anything done.  It's still here, drifing around, threatening to bring me back down.  

So tomorrow will be another day, where I hope to awaken early.  A day where I hope my self discipline will be apparent, a day when I will start to move on.

See you tomorrow.
