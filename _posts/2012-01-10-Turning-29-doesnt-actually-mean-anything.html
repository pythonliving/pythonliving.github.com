<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7979929270222783"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It's quite satisfying that even though I'm actually on a personal vacation, one of the things I </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">want</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> to do is write. Would that be considered a sign of a lifestyle that truly works for you? I think so. I've been thinking a fair amount about my life over the past couple of days, as I recently turned 29. What I want out of life, and other serious reflections. 29 isn't a marker per se, but it is a stark reminder that I'm only a year from 30.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And that's where my mind wanders when I think about it. I had a couple of things I wanted to get done by the time I was 30. Now, as my time grows thin, I wonder if they will actually get done. The awesome part about being with someone who's awesome too, is that they want to help you reach those goals (if after reflection you still really want to do them).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What was one of my goals? </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I've always wanted to hike the entire <a href="http://www.appalachiantrail.org/">Appalachian Trail</a>.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> However, as I've gotten older I realized the reasoning behind the hoped endeavor. I wanted to do something that would show what I was capable of. Definitely part of the whole thing was for selfish reasons, I wanted something I could show off with. Not the best of reasons, but it would definitely have been a status item in my book. </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But, the main reason?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> I have always felt that such an experience would be an important experience to have in my life. So much time away from society, so much time away from the easy amenities. </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A chance to feel closer to nature, to realize existence as a wanderer.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> To have to endure the rain, wind and cold without an easy getaway. I want to push myself, and this was a test I felt I should take.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This kind of, actually, makes me think that it might be time to make another one of those life 'TODO' lists. Help me get things written down. Life priorities, they make things exciting. &nbsp;</span></span></div>
