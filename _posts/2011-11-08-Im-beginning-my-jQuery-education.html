<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4444744379725307" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Today I&rsquo;ve started working on a new project. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m learning how to use and interact with jQuery. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned a bit about javascript, but mainly all from W3schools tutorials. &nbsp;Now I&rsquo;m going to start going through a <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works#jQuery:_The_Basics">jQuery tutorial</a> to figure out how to make and use effects for our website. &nbsp;This will be the first time I&rsquo;ve truly started applying my programming to a work project.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ll let you know how things are getting along with jQuery in the next couple of days. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fairly daunting at the moment. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been instructed, however, that I should keep in mind that javascript isn&rsquo;t something you can really get an overall picture of. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a language that grew and thus needs to be learned bit by bit. &nbsp;In some ways that reminds me of the English language, and how much it was affected by so many other languages and though patterns. &nbsp;</span></div>
