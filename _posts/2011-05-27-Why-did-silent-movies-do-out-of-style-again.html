<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7401557716075331" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Today I made a silent movie for our Android Application, Curvy. &nbsp;About halfway through I started getting a headache and slight nausea simply from restarting the background music over and over again, so I could set the written aspects set up appropriately in time with the music. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still a bit under the weather from it as I write now. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On a brighter note, despite the head and stomach aches, I rediscovered my drive today. &nbsp;I found that the creation aspect of making that little ditty was so enthralling, that the one thing that really made me move away was physical illness. &nbsp;That is quite amazing. &nbsp;It gives me excitement for creating my next big thing, a cribbage tutorial for the Cribbage website. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In the mean time, </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1jTU-Tj1SY"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">here is my video</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;I hope you enjoy, and don&rsquo;t also have a stomach/head ache from it all. &nbsp;If you do let me know, I may need to make a disclaimer. ;)</span></div>
