<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.207058678381145" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The MIT lectures I&rsquo;m following have a great instructor leading the lectures. He throws candy at his students, and hits them or others near them, often. :) &nbsp;Not to mention he discusses the topics intelligently and with good articulation.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He&rsquo;s a decent orator, however I&rsquo;ve been finding that to make true sense of his discussions that reviewing the reading material first may be in order. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been watching the lectures first, to get more background before I do the readings, and having done half of the readings today I am noticing the readings are making a ton more sense. &nbsp;As with most courses, looks like much of the reading is necessary for true comprehension. &nbsp;I may have to withhold lecture viewing, where I get to see more kids pelted with sugar packets, until more of the reading is completed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll get back to you on how that goes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the things I&rsquo;m running into, is the need for a strong understanding of mathematical logic in order to make the most of this coursework. &nbsp;Most of my background is in a variety of languages, historical and cultural backgrounds. &nbsp;I have two bachelors (German, Medieval studies), and a minor (English). &nbsp;As you can see, my mathematical background is minimal. &nbsp;This is unlike Robey, my partner, whose studies range into doctorate level coursework. &nbsp;This is not to say that my personal ability to grasp mathematical concepts is difficult, quite to the contrary. &nbsp;My own studies in Math are limited, however my other training (linguistic and cultural), I feel, provides me with a good base. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Despite my confidence in my abilities, I am sure to prove myself wrong here very soon. &nbsp;Delving into new territories always proves ones inability before true ability and understanding takes its place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
