<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I mentioned earlier this week that I was going to start reading and learning how to use the jQuery library. &nbsp;Well, I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to look at it since I mentioned it. &nbsp;Instead I&rsquo;ve been fairly busy with some &lsquo;priority projects&rsquo; for my part-time translation job. &nbsp;Albeit I&rsquo;m learning lots of new vocabulary, so it&rsquo;s good for my intellect in that aspect. &nbsp;Of which that brings me to today&rsquo;s question; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">just how much learning at one time is too much?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How does a person truly know what their limits are, when it comes to learning?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Colleges assume that only a certain amount of courses is plausible, if the student wishes to receive good marks. &nbsp;The assumptions of just how much a person is able to work during a day without going wonky have changed over time, but there seems to have always been some kind of expectation. &nbsp;It seems to depend, partially, on the mental and physical strain of the job they are doing. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But like all things the more practiced you are at a particular thing the easier it is to do. &nbsp;Therefore, the more physically practiced you are the more you can work that job without becoming exhausted. &nbsp;That would then, subsequently, also apply to mental strain. &nbsp;The more you strain yourself mentally at particular tasks you soon, after much experience, learn it is less taxing. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Thus people learn and move up the career ladder in whatever field they choose after a period of time. &nbsp;But how do you know what that limit is? &nbsp;How do you know when you&rsquo;re pushing yourself to your own personal limit? &nbsp;Is it the stress building up in your shoulders? &nbsp;Beyond the need for sleep or food, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">when do you come to that wall where you can&rsquo;t go any further?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Especially if that wall is always expanding the more comfortable you get with your current work?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I would like to think that I&rsquo;m pushing myself as hard as I can, but I don&rsquo;t think I am. &nbsp;I am getting work done, and learning new things all the time. &nbsp;Still, I think there is a trick to it. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Many people push themselves so much because they are, I think, looking for that wall. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They are trying to find their limit, but they don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;ve passed it until they crash. &nbsp;What seems to happen for me is that I start to feel a pressure, either mentally or physically, and will often flirt right beside the wall for a length of time. &nbsp;Then I crash and spend an extra day recovering. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">With translation what I&rsquo;ve found works, is that if I need to work longer hours </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I make sure to take substantial break between my work to keep my wits sharp.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;I work two hours, and then take at least an hour break. &nbsp;My work is much more spread throughout the day, but my translation stays more accurate for a longer period of time. &nbsp;I have to do less re-reading or double-checking of my work. &nbsp;I also keep my stress levels down. &nbsp;I know that for many people this kind of work habit is not a possibility. &nbsp;But, in all honesty, who doesn&rsquo;t still accomplish a slight similar process even in the work place? &nbsp;Instead of taking an hour like myself, one fills it with chatter with co-workers or meetings, coffee breaks and trips to the restroom. &nbsp;Everyone does it until you reach that level of flexibility where you can choose to do a more obvious hour break and back again for a couple more.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But have I actually reached the wall? &nbsp;Have I learned what my limits are? &nbsp;I think each day has it&rsquo;s own set of limits, based on the amount of sleep, quality of food intake, and general emotional stress levels you are currently experiencing. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Learning that each day does not mean 10 hours of exemplary work, but it may mean one day you spend 12 hours and the next 4.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Learning to allow for alterations in exemplary work within yourself is the most effective way to learn where your wall is. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not pushing yourself to meet the 10 hours each day, because then, more often than not, you crash. &nbsp;Crashing causes damage and recovery time. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Prevent crashing and you&rsquo;ll push yourself harder and cover more distance than you would have thought possible. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
