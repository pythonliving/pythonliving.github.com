<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So my game is out. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s exciting, and I&rsquo;m a little drained. &nbsp;I still have a lot I want to do, but I figure from here it will be a bit slower going. &nbsp;I have to work some more on translation type things, and also work on other important work aspects. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fairly awesome though, I had my nephew try it out tonight, and he seemed to like it. &nbsp;He gave me some suggestions for it, but they will take a while to implement. &nbsp;I will let you know when some of them are in the works/ready to publish.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I have this massive list on my board of all the things I want to do for my game. &nbsp;There are so many things and they are mostly certainly more complicated than what I&rsquo;ve already learned. &nbsp;I guess the only thing I can do after I &lsquo;finish&rsquo; (probably will never feel truly finished), is to start up my Tower Defense game I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of. &nbsp;A game that I will play for hours and hours, one which convinces me to stay up til 4am playing (ah the days of my youth with Warcraft 3 TD). &nbsp;Anyways, back to work I go. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: Now that I&rsquo;m busy producing HTML games, when will I have time for python?</span></div>
