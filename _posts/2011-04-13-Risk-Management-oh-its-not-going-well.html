<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6926818329375237" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even if this blog never brings anything to our venture, I must say that writing it is extremely cathartic. &nbsp;Revisiting my emotions surrounding the events that took place. &nbsp;Writing about them, remembering them. &nbsp;My dreams, my nightmares about my experiences, they are dwindling. &nbsp;Less and less do I relive my pain during my sleep. &nbsp;More often I find myself waking up with energy and excitement at learning something each day. &nbsp;Energy for creating something, working on building a business. &nbsp;Building a business in some areas that I know nothing about. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s incredibly scary. &nbsp;At this point I would have it no other way.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the hardest parts about trying this venture is the constant criticism and concerns Robey and I hear from others. &nbsp;Others who could or would never do such a thing on their own. &nbsp;So many people are afraid to try something like this. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so risky.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m sure many are also thinking of what it might mean to them, if we fail. &nbsp;You can learn about hope and faith...but to truly know it...that&rsquo;s the trick isn&rsquo;t it? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think many in my situation know what it&rsquo;s like. &nbsp;So many people go through life simply working for other people. &nbsp;To take full control like this, is a rarity. &nbsp;Each day is a fight to try to make sure you have the money to pay rent, the money to pay your phone bill. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re having to teach yourself things, and learn every day because you don&rsquo;t have others to lean on. &nbsp;Robey and I are in this together, and we only truly have each other. &nbsp;</span></div>
