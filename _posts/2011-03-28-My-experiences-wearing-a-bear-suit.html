<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">How to keep bouts of depression from preventing creativity, learning, and personal productivity. &nbsp;Please note, these are all personal opinions and theories of my own. &nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">

</ol><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most of my life depression has come along for a good reason. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s normally my body and mind &nbsp;telling me there are things I need to process. &nbsp;As yourself why you are depressed. &nbsp;Did something life altering just happen? &nbsp;Do you have ghosts in your past that aren&rsquo;t letting go? &nbsp;Did you react strongly to something in the news? &nbsp;Sometimes a simple news article can bring fighting in the middle east to a more stark reality than previous. &nbsp;Those news stories can relate to personal life events, and those connections can sometimes be treacherous. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Identifying the cause sooner rather than letter will help you recover faster.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;As painful as it may be, think seriously about why you are depressed. &nbsp;</span><br /><ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Allow yourself some time. &nbsp;</span></li>

<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Never feel guilty.</span></li>
</ol><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once you start feeling guilty about not getting started quickly enough or not meeting goals of recovery, you set a poor pattern of self reflection. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Never set large goals during your recovery process. &nbsp;Only make plans.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Setting goals for yourself while trying to get out of depression is only going to make yourself even more depressed when you don&rsquo;t meet your goals. &nbsp;This will invariably happen, because you are not in tip top shape when recovering. &nbsp;If you meet your goals, you may have just learned a very effective way to shove your feelings under the carpet, so to speak. &nbsp;Storing those feelings away now can make it even harder to deal with depression you may feel later on in life. &nbsp;I feel that if you don&rsquo;t deal with the emotions you have currently, they will only continue to haunt you in one way or another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Take things day by day. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ol><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I feel that one of the best ways to keep going each day is to set a daily goal. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;This may sound contrary to my last paragraph, however I feel that this is different. &nbsp;A daily goal can be something as simple as going for a walk or run. &nbsp;It could be choosing to do one load of laundry. &nbsp;It could be deciding to work on one project, and choosing one aspect of it. &nbsp;The goal itself won&rsquo;t seem as foreboding. &nbsp;It will seem reachable. &nbsp;This idea is especially good if you are employed. &nbsp;If you are trying to grieve and deal with depression, it can be very difficult when working the daily grind. &nbsp;Completing a goal during each evening can make your free time feel productive and subsequently satisfying. &nbsp;As said previously, don&rsquo;t set large goals up for yourself. &nbsp;They can seem unattainable, and can sometimes only serve to deepen your depression. &nbsp;A daily goal can help you re-establish your self confidence and help you start to be productive again. When I was in college during my undergrad I suffered some severe depression during fall term dead week of my senior year. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t attend a single course that week, in spite of it being that week when you collect final notes. &nbsp;I was trying to process some serious internal emotional conflicts in regarding my family, more specifically my father. &nbsp;I choose during that week to forgo attending class, and instead simply started running. &nbsp;I ran one mile each day, and then came home and read and studied as I could. &nbsp;That one daily goal helped me immensely. &nbsp;</span><br /><ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">
<li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Recognize that those feelings may never fully go away, and that&rsquo;s okay.</span></li>
</ol><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I feel that those therapists out there who feel that you can make your reasons for depression no longer affect you are crazy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I feel that my life experiences will be with me always. &nbsp;Things that I feel bad for are always going to be there, unless I do something about them, and even then I&rsquo;m still going to remember them once in a while and feel bad about them again. &nbsp;As much as I can try to grieve out all my feelings of loss from my grandmothers death it&rsquo;s never going to fully go away, and I don&rsquo;t want it to. &nbsp;I feel that choosing to be okay with keeping that feeling around is important. &nbsp;It helps me to connect more deeply with others. &nbsp;If you think you can &lsquo;fully recover&rsquo; from horrifying life experiences, I think you are just another example of that person who can shove those concerns and emotions under the carpet. &nbsp;That you are simply choosing to make it disappear, but those feelings will still affect you. &nbsp;If I didn&rsquo;t still feel sorrowful when I thought about the death of a loved one I would be deeply concerned about myself. &nbsp;Understand that this experience is going to be a part of you for the rest of your life, and accept it. &nbsp;Recognize that it simply is, and the choice of it making you good or bad is entirely your own doing. &nbsp;People can have some influence on how you feel about yourself, but you are the final verdict. &nbsp;This experience with depression will always be with you, and part of you may always be susceptible to it again. &nbsp;This is not a bad thing. &nbsp;Experiencing depression does not make you a bad person, and finding yourself succumbing to it again is not bad. &nbsp;It simply means you need some more time for recovery. As winter comes every year, the plants always return in the spring. &nbsp;The hard thing to do is to find what makes it better for you.</span></div>
