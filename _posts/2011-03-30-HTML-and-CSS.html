<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9568150797858834" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Part of assisting with the development of Flaminglunchbox, was my &lsquo;take over&rsquo; of the website so to speak. &nbsp;I must say, that learning HTML is exciting. &nbsp;Not to mention seeing how CSS is used to support HTML in designing and creating websites. &nbsp;Today was mostly devoted towards recognizing the connections between the HTML code and then updating it as necessary. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s amazing the flexibility it gives you. &nbsp;How easy it was to adjust and maneuver the header. &nbsp;Or how you can simply create certain designs and then use a key phrase to use them on whichever page you choose. &nbsp;When I used to write or my blog on </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Livejournal </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">back in 2003-04 I would use some minor HTML coding in order to emphasize bold, italics, underline, and linking. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m very glad I had seen this information before, as to see the code and recognize how it works was kind of a refresher today. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you, refreshing that test page is a treat. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Tomorrow I&rsquo;m allowing myself some time to work on this blog&rsquo;s HTML. &nbsp;It should be a bit different, because for the most part I will only be adjusting one page and mainly the CSS. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll also have a lot more free reign. &nbsp;I think. &nbsp;Honestly I&rsquo;m still learning so I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to expect.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Quick question: &nbsp;how does one, being self employed, really get away with allowing oneself a sick day? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s seems like quite a tricky thing. &nbsp;Another question. &nbsp;How does one recover self worth when flashes of the pain you felt during a previous job continue to haunt you? &nbsp;When images of how it made you feel about yourself are always lurking, waiting for something else to get you down. &nbsp;Then they hook into you, and pull you further into the abyss of self loathing.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The only thing that makes my current self employment feel gratifying (besides the work itself), is an increase in sales. &nbsp;With part of successful entrepreneurship being luck, I&rsquo;m guessing the main goal is to find a way to make the work pay for itself. &nbsp;That way as long as the work is gratifying, I&rsquo;m satisfied. &nbsp;Not to mention that setting your own hours is a truly beautiful thing. &nbsp;I There are always pluses to be found.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">++++++++++++++</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(concatenation?!?)</span></div>
