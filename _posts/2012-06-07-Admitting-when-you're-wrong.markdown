No one likes to do this...admitting you're wrong can be humliating at times.  But being unable to admit it prevents you from accomplishing so many important things.  

I have a difficult time admitting I don't understand code sometimes.  Mostly it's when I'm reviewing code I've written and Robey is helping me to analyze it.  I sometimes get a bit red in the face about it, and it's such a waste of time.  If I had allowed myself to be more open minded about my own faults, I would have been able to move forward already.  

When I talk about it with Robey, others, or just write about it here I realize how stupid it is.  I'm human, I err.  Add in that I'm learning how to code because I'm unexperienced at it just adds to the hilarity of it all.  I don't know what I'm doing but I can't admit that I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean...that's just dumb.

So, as you can see, this has been one of my major learning hurdles over the past year.  Learning how to identify when I'm wrong and attempting to ignore it.  The other part of this puzzle is, once I've realized I'm trying to ignore I'm wrong, learning to admit it without much emotional turmoil and being able to move on smoothly.  

Learning how much of an issues this is within myself I've started to see other people with the same problem.  It's amazing just how many people have the same problem as I do.  Oddly heartening.
