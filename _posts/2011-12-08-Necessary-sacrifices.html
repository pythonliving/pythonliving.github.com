<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.14462379459291697" style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I read a blog post from </span><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/12/no-choice-1.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Fsethsmainblog+%28Seth%27s+Blog%29"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seth Godin</span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> earlier today. &nbsp;It was about how </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">making the dream happen involved sacrifices.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;It involves sacrifices even as simple as getting up in the morning when you&rsquo;re still tired. &nbsp;It involves realizing that you might make the mistake, and owning up to it not only helps you grow but makes your chances that much better at making your dream happen. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So what happened to me last night? &nbsp;I stayed up late reading a good book. &nbsp;Not only that but I went to see the new &lsquo;Muppet&rsquo; movie and then went to a local restaurant with some friends afterwards to chat. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m tired this morning.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;m more tired than normal. &nbsp;One of my most difficult challenges is simply waking up in the morning. &nbsp;If I don&rsquo;t wake up before 9:30am I always feel guilty. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I don&rsquo;t seem to have overarching passion that makes me wake up.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Then I have this small seed of guilt hiding inside me all day, preventing me from being as productive.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Having watched the &lsquo;Muppet&rsquo; movie I was reminded of one of my heroes, Jim Henson. &nbsp;That man made sacrifices all the time. &nbsp;Sacrifices to make creation his life, and he created his dream that lives within so many of us. &nbsp;After being reminded of one of my heroes I couldn&rsquo;t get out of my head was how much </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I wanted to create something that would wow people.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Something that would make them stop and look and think, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">something that would make them realize how much I was capable of.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You see, that last part, that is the problem.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s part of why I can&rsquo;t get up in the morning. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m doing this sheerly for a self-worth boost. &nbsp;I want to create something amazing not only to make money, but to prove to my peers that I&rsquo;m impressive. &nbsp;Right now I&rsquo;m going it for myself and myself alone. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If I fail I&rsquo;m only letting myself down.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For Jim Henson </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">he was doing it for the children. &nbsp;He was doing it for the adults.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;He was hoping to spread a message and he did so. &nbsp;He had a passion. &nbsp;I have a passion to satisfy my own self worth. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Without a passion that surpasses myself, what am I to do? &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Can passion develop?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Can I find a part of myself that finds satisfaction from my work so much so that I wake up early each morning? &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Is simply creating games to become a better programmer and web developer enough?</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Having my own game to work on has definitely increased my excitement towards my work. &nbsp;I have a product that I feel seriously involved in. &nbsp;A product that I can either make, or break, by my passion. &nbsp;But </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I still have issues getting up in the morning.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;I always preferred sleeping in later, but feeling like I am constantly being judged by others because I wake up at 10am each morning always nags me. &nbsp;No, our business isn&rsquo;t incredibly successful. &nbsp;Yes, we&rsquo;re still working on making it work. &nbsp;Yes, I got up at 10am this morning. &nbsp;I guess I&rsquo;m just never serious enough.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But the funny thing is...sometimes I work until midnight. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes I start to get passionate, but am interrupted because the rest of the world is on a different schedule than I am.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Then to stay focused I start cutting things out, which then makes me a bit grumpy because I need to be social. &nbsp;So what is the compromise? &nbsp;So many programmers and successful web developers/programmers are known to be somewhat socially disinclined. &nbsp;They hole up to keep their passion fueled and to keep working. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Do I change to be more like these programmers? &nbsp;Do I stay in and become a ghost in the night? &nbsp;Is that how I make this work?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: How I learned to crochet and what it means about my programming.</span></div>
