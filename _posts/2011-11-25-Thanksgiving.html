<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It&rsquo;s Thanksgiving day and I&rsquo;m sitting at home programming. &nbsp;Oh how the world has changed. &nbsp;This year instead of the normal, smaller Thanksgiving gathering of my family and then subsequent gathering up at Robey&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s house, my family pretty much decided to have an impromptu family reunion. &nbsp;Most of my immediate family (1st cousin&rsquo;s and Aunt&rsquo;s and Uncle&rsquo;s) are all living in Alabama. &nbsp;But my family likes to stay &lsquo;tight&rsquo;, and thus an impromptu reunion consists of mostly second and third cousins, all from the local northwest region. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So this Saturday I&rsquo;ll be gathering with about 40 of my closest relatives for a day of shared goodies, chatter, and general loudness.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Some families may be quite, my family is quite the opposite. &nbsp;There will be at least 12 kids there that I know of, not including other random add ins that might occur last minute. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On top of it all Robey and I will be hosting my two nieces Kate and Liz for at least one, if not two nights, while all the extended family is housed at other varying family residential locations. &nbsp;It will be fun to have the girls over for a sleep over. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re going to get any rest this upcoming weekend though. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s going to be busy. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the things I do enjoy about Thanksgiving (besides all the amazing holiday traditional food items), is that it provides for a grand opportunity to see people you might not normally visit with. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even if family can get crazy, or awkward conversations occur, family helps to provide context for the rest of the world in a safe way. </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;From my experiences, there is almost no family in existence that doesn&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s own share of differing opinions between it&rsquo;s members. &nbsp;Family also has the tendency to forgive more often, and let go, because, well, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re family&rsquo;. &nbsp;When all is said and done you&rsquo;re still expected to see them next year at the gathering. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So if you&rsquo;re Holiday season this year is stressing you out, remember that your family was and always will be the first battle ground towards social prowess. &nbsp;You learn to slide over topics, or you learn when it&rsquo;s okay to delve in a little deeper. &nbsp;You also learn how to identify certain types of people in a crowd, like who has the power in a group. &nbsp;So, from a much more business&rsquo;esque standpoint take a step back and try to view your family as how someone from the outside might see them. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s how some of my best personal growth has occurred. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: My first attempt at an HTML5 game: Science Fiction Tower Power</span></div>
