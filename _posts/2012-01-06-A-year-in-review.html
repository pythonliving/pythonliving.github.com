<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.20431015687063336"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">New Year&rsquo;s resolutions are nice. &nbsp;They help you get excited for another year. &nbsp;You get to review and possibly revise your priorities. &nbsp;However, I think people don&rsquo;t do nearly enough of reviewing the awesome things they did the year before. &nbsp;Celebrating what&rsquo;s already happened. &nbsp;In some ways, New Year&rsquo;s resolutions are exciting because they get you excited for making changes in your life. &nbsp;Changes that possibly didn&rsquo;t occur the previous year. &nbsp;What if everyone also took the time to review what they accomplished and what they were proud of. &nbsp;It almost feels like that needs to happen first before any re-establishment of this years priorities can occur.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What did I do this past year? &nbsp;I challenged my perceptions about the world, and myself. &nbsp;I started out the year by asking myself if I wanted to work in a job that made me extremely unhappy, where I felt like I was being disrespected and degraded. &nbsp;I realized that I didn&rsquo;t want to. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So I changed my life. &nbsp;I quit my job and started working full-time with Robey on FlamingLunchbox. &nbsp;I started learning how to program. &nbsp;I started a blog, which I&rsquo;ve now written over 180 entries for. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned how to use graphic editing programs (mainly Inkscape and Gimp). &nbsp;I learned how to do HTML, CSS some Javascript and to understand a little jQuery. &nbsp;I helped to create and market a Kickstarter project, which was later fully funded. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I am now a partner in a small business. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned about how to set up a business, and some of the steps necessary to maintain it. &nbsp;By no means an expert, but at least I&rsquo;m starting to get an idea as to how much work it really is, and how satisfying it can be when you make it work. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I also gained the opportunity to start translating. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve wanted to find a way to incorporate German back into my daily life, and I was very, very lucky to get this. &nbsp;I feel like my brains on fire, and that my brain is now consequently a phoenix so that I don&rsquo;t totally loose all brain power.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Regarding my personal life I would say I&rsquo;ve learned more about forgiveness. &nbsp;That is a continuous and hard lesson to work on, but it&rsquo;s made my heart much happier. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned how important a good friend can be. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also learned how to fish, crochet a pineapple pattern, and I&rsquo;ve canned more food this year than I ever had previously.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">What have you done? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></div>
