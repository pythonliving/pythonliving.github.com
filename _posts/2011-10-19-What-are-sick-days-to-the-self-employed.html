<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was sick the other day, yet I still posted an entry to my blog, and I still worked on what I could. &nbsp;In all honesty I didn&rsquo;t work that much. &nbsp;I was incredibly foggy headed. &nbsp;I even missed a soccer game! &nbsp;Not working that one day left me feeling incredibly behind, more so than I&rsquo;d ever felt at a normal job. &nbsp;If I was at a normal 40 per week job I would have thought, it&rsquo;s okay I&rsquo;ll get to it tomorrow. Nothing I can do about it now. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Right now it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s an option to get sick. &nbsp;Every lost hour is another hour until I can create a product that will finance my food and living situation. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a painful realization after only working in the standard 40 hours per week workforce. &nbsp;If I get lost in thought, or distracted because of something small but relative, it makes it that much harder to get work done.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In other words, if you&rsquo;re not working at your most focused, highest level, you&rsquo;re not working hard enough. &nbsp;If you take time off to read a book, you may be recovering but your work load doesn&rsquo;t magically get picked up by your co-workers. &nbsp;You won&rsquo;t make the money to put food on the table, and you most definitely won&rsquo;t be paying rent this month. &nbsp;While invigorating, I&rsquo;m not sure what I think about this new pressure quite yet. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Up Next Time: Problem Set 6; Problem 3 of 5, Part 1</span></div>
