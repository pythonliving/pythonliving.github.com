<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9736747157294303" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Today I filed for unemployment. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That was painful. &nbsp;I had been avoiding it for a good while simply because of the fear of possibly having to interact with my former employers. &nbsp;As they still have to review my application, I know that it&rsquo;s a possibility. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to them ever again. &nbsp;They hurt me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m finally able to smile without concern. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m able to be happy again, and not feel that I&rsquo;m totally incapable of doing anything well. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For so long I had this horrid self worth that followed me around. &nbsp;I consistently felt like the bottom of the pile. &nbsp;I was barely better than the gum on the bottom of a shoe. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m slowly crawling out of that pile. &nbsp;In part this blog is an example of just how much self reflection and work it&rsquo;s taking to get out. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t even imagine what it would have been like if I had stayed any longer in that horrid environment. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m scared to think of it. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Touching letters with their stationary and reading their names. &nbsp;Glancing through my old emails. &nbsp;Each time I handled another piece I felt my heart tighten and my shoulders rise as if to prepare for a hit. &nbsp;Thinking of it now makes me want to cry from utter anger and frustration. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I am never going to let someone make me feel that way about myself again.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
