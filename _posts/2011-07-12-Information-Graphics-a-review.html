<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4069886668585241" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I know everyone loves </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/flaminglunchbox.net/document/d/1z415vQCWKPPwf00w1XXELrpfhwGzAfBh6y22720h6ec/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInfographics"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Information Graphics</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, or Infographics. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the new best way to describe and understand information by using images, flow charts and text all at once. &nbsp;Lately I feel like it&rsquo;s been a tad overdone. &nbsp;People are getting way too excited about it, and humorous and interesting things are being done constantly. &nbsp;Now, I do think that they are useful, and since they are gaining tremendously in popularity it brings up an interesting question. &nbsp;What does this mean for educational practices?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Look at current day text books in for many high school students. &nbsp;Those books are changing more and more to become a large collection of Infographics. &nbsp;Look at the books many children learn by. &nbsp;Those collectors books regarding history where they have images and graphs and writing all over large glossy pages. &nbsp;For so many high school students that is the trend. &nbsp;Then for many of them they go from glossy pages and pictures to the original source-work of many classic writers. &nbsp;People talk about symbol shock when it comes to mathematics or learning new languages, what about page shock. &nbsp;I can understand that for many children who are overwhelmed with websites, TV shows, and games that are purely Info-graphic in nature; I can see how the next generation can be severely intimidated by primary source materials. &nbsp;Going from a mashed up recreation of Hamlet to straight Chaucer in college would be incredibly intimidating. &nbsp;So many teachers are choosing not to do the more difficult material because, honestly, who expects a high school student to understand such things in most US public educational systems? &nbsp;Perhaps it&rsquo;s my medieval background, but I feel that to be able to look at texts and recognize similarities between Middle English words and modern English should not be difficult. &nbsp;I was continuously astounded in college when some of my fellow classmates had difficulties recognizing these factors. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Back to the original point. &nbsp;Infographics, while incredibly helpful in getting the point across, are, I feel, making it horridly difficult for the next generation to connect with primary source material from anything previous to the late 20th century. &nbsp;Yes, they can read books, but unless the books are much more simplistically written it can be difficult for them to get through it. &nbsp;There is so much more out there to read in order to be considered &lsquo;well read&rsquo;. &nbsp;Does reading simply written books increase your ability to read and decipher? &nbsp;Does it increase intellect like so many think? &nbsp;What is the future of Infographics?</span></div>
