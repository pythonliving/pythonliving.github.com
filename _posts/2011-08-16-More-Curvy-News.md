Curvy has been pretty hot on the docket lately.  We've had several reviews posted and wanted to share them with you; androidworld, The App Informer, and Scripted Genius.  Loads of thanks to the authors for their support!  As far as we can tell on the Italian website we're reviewed well, but that’s based on the Google Translate and the random deciphering of someone with partial ability in Spanish.  One could say that it's not the most accurate way to understand another language.

*Other News*
* Soon to come, Curvy for iPhone.  As we've not developed for an iOS previously, please expect a slight delay as Robey begins the process of learning another programming language.  
* If you were a backer or simply interested in our Kickstarter project, you can follow along with our company projects and Kickstarter progress here on the FlamingLunchbox blog.   

Until next time!
