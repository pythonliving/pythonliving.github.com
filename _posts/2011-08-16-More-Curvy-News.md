Curvy has been pretty hot on the docket lately.  We've had several reviews posted and wanted to share them with you; androidworld, The App Informer, and Scripted Genius.  Loads of thanks to the authors for their support!  As far as we can tell on the Italian website we're reviewed well, but thatâ€™s based on the Google Translate and the random deciphering of someone with partial ability in Spanish.  One could say that it's not the most accurate way to understand another language.

*Other News*
* Soon to come, Curvy for iPhone.  As we've not developed for an iOS previously, please expect a slight delay as Robey begins the process of learning another programming language.  
* If you were a backer or simply interested in our Kickstarter project, you can follow along with our company projects and Kickstarter progress here on the FlamingLunchbox blog.   

Until next time!
