<div style="background-color: transparent;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12256572442129254"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I took a walk yesterday. &nbsp;I walked from our house to a local movie theater. &nbsp;On my walk I was reminded of a phrase my high school choir director once told our choir, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t spend 10 minutes by yourself without going crazy, then you&rsquo;re not okay.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about that phrase, and about what it means ever since. &nbsp;My impression, is that if you can&rsquo;t spend at least ten minutes alone with your thoughts, then you are unhappy with something in your life. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re so unhappy, that you should really do something about it. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I revisited where I was last year, at this time, I realized just how much has changed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m....happy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m truly happy with where my life is going right now. &nbsp;Sure, learning how to do all of this is scary, and I have no idea where this will have me end up. &nbsp;But, I feel like I actually have control of where I am. &nbsp;I took a 45 minute walk with only my iPod to keep me company, and all I was, was happy. &nbsp;</span></strong></div>
