Today I watched a couple of interesting videos from [TED](http://www.ted.com/), ideas worth spreading.  The first was a talk done by Seth Godin, [Stop Stealing Dreams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=sXpbONjV1Jc).  This talk was one I'd heard before, partially out of my own mouth.  The idea that creativity is being stifled by the education system and standardized testing.  

It reminds me of a conversation I had with my sister when I was 16, before I left for my exchange trip to Germany.  It was about a class she was taking and a book she was reading, about how ineffective standardized testing is at actually determining capabilities and intelligence.  Ever since that conversation I've never cared about them, which probably affected my ability to score well enough on them to get into Graduate school.  

The second video was by Sir Ken Robinson [Bring on the learning revolution!](http://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution.html).  His conversation touched me specifically, particularly with his comments regarding ADHD.  He discussed how 100 years ago people wouldn't have been given a 'disorder', they would have been told they learn differently, or that they were more inherently dancers and creators.  Sitting and learning facts doesn't prove anything.

I don't think intelligence or ability has anything to do with how much formalized education you have.  Sure, a certificate is great and all, but only because of the mass amounts of educational institutions that say they do.  How many people do you know who get a college education, even a PhD and realize how little it really means.  

For me, my diploma is only important because it reminds me of the awesome things I had the opportunity to learn in school.  Amazing things about Germany, Scandinavia and the Medieval Ages.  I think the only thing a diploma can mean to the outside world is that I'm able to finish projects I start.  You can also do that by simply creating something. 

I have a good friend who paints.  She's awesome.  She didn't know much about painting when she started, but she's kept with it.  Now she's creating awesome pieces, and continuously expanding her knowledge.  She's creating and doing things, and she completes things.  I like to think that's comparable to what a degree means to many college graduates.  The difference is, she does this all of her own volition.  She's not being told by some professor that it's a requirement, she's choosing to do it.  How many college graduates can say the same?
