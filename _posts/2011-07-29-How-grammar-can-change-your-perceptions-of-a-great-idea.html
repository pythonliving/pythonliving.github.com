<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8901079602073878" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As someone who speaks another language, and has studied several others I always find it humorous when people become super sticklers about grammar. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, grammar is necessary, but I&rsquo;ve lived in situations where grammar wasn&rsquo;t as necessary as understanding. &nbsp;To be picky about grammar sometimes kept some exchange students from speaking up at all for fear of saying something silly. &nbsp;How are you supposed to learn the correct way to do things unless you go forth without fear of doing something wrong? &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Unfortunately I had the gumption to learn German as my main secondary language. &nbsp;Germans are very proud of their language (as they should be) and thus are very particular about grammar. &nbsp;Many of their grammar rules make logical sense and German spelling is fairly phonetic, yet despite it&rsquo;s logic there are plenty of German grammar rules. &nbsp;So I choose to study a language spoken by a group of people very particular about grammar, with precise logical grammar rules and lots of them. &nbsp;Suffice it to say, I was corrected </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">a lot</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now, without those corrections I would never have become a bietter German speaker. &nbsp;So with this logic, it brings me to this question. &nbsp;Why do I criticize others for poor grammar online, especially when I don&rsquo;t know what their native language is? &nbsp;For many people online it&rsquo;s not apparent. &nbsp;In the US especially, where many people come from various different historical backgrounds, you can never know what their native language is. &nbsp;There are many Americans whose parents speak their home countries native language, but they themselves do not. &nbsp;Yet, I believe, they are still affected by the exposure to their parents quasi English skills. &nbsp;Should we judge or criticize their grammar more because of a circumstance they had no power over? &nbsp;Especially when we really have no way to tell one way or the other? &nbsp;Not to mention, when they&rsquo;ve already worked harder to get there than many of us have.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To assume that the person is a native English speaker when they post in English online seems unfair. &nbsp;If they are not, we are taking in a certain set of criteria when determining their &ldquo;abilities&rdquo; and we are judging them on it. &nbsp;Many will argue, what other option do we have? &nbsp;Which, when it comes down to that, you&rsquo;ve found yourself in an argument for or against stereotyping. &nbsp;Many of the great artists and creators out there had a rule that encouraged idea growth; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">don&rsquo;t knock it till you&rsquo;ve tried it</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;Look at many of the great hackers out there, they try not to judge because </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">who knows where the good ideas will come from?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">With this thought in mind I will continue to plow ahead. &nbsp;I will also try to take my own common sense to heart and do my best not to allow judgment to occur when I see grammar errors. &nbsp;Just because someone cannot communicate with you on your level in your native language, doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t know what they're talking about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
