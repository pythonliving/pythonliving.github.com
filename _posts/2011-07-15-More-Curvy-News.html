Apologies for no posts for two days. &nbsp;I went back and was reviewing my current mental status in a recent post, and it then it affected my entire week. &nbsp;Everything regarding my former place of work has been on my mind, threatening me on a daily basis. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s taken hold of my focus and shredded it slightly. &nbsp;Not to mention I ran into one of the people who escorted me off the premises from my previous job at my local hangout. &nbsp;We noticed each other... and then quickly pretended the other didn&rsquo;t exist. &nbsp;Always a great experience. &nbsp;Despite all, I was mentally capable to send out another round of notifications to all those would be Curvy fans out there (in other words, I sent out Press releases to everyone and their Uncle), and do other work-like things.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In more exciting news, I&rsquo;ve created (what I think) is a pretty schnazzy </span><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21971644/Curvy%20Press%20Packet/curvypresspacket.html"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Press Release page</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. &nbsp;It has all our related materials and it looks exactly like our website!! &nbsp;Oh my, I&rsquo;m actually learning how to do HTML and CSS now! &nbsp;Thank you! &nbsp;I know how to cut and paste and do quick debugging, it&rsquo;s crazy! &nbsp;I think my next step is to start reorganizing the site and then find good and interesting ways to add in some javascript for learning purposes. &nbsp;You have been warned.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Curvy is continuing to get attention, much to our excitement. &nbsp;We have over 4,000 Facebook likes now, along with 300 +1&rsquo;s (Thank you Google). &nbsp;Curvy was recently approved for the </span><a href="http://chromeexperiments.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Chrome Experiments</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> website! &nbsp;We&rsquo;re also getting almost daily emails from various sources wanting to add either the mobile or the HTML5 version to their &lsquo;collection&rsquo; online. &nbsp;All in all we&rsquo;re continuously growing and increasing, albeit slower than wanted. &nbsp;But, we&rsquo;re still growing.</span></div>
