I did awaken early this morning, as I hoped yesterday, however this morning I had a reason and not simple initiative as I had hoped.  I had a dentist appointment.  Things went well enough as I now have whiter teeth and no horrifying life imprints were left on the people who cleaned them.  

After my drive yesterday I'm doing better today, but I'm still feeling the edge of an attack if I don't be careful.  The hope is to finish up the tagging system today, so that my blog will be finished and off my docket.  Well, for now at least.

I found a useful post that includes code to create a *next* and *previous* button on your individual blog pages.  It is discussed [here](https://github.com/qdot/nonpolynomial.com/blob/master/_layouts/post.html).
I've added it to my website.  However, I'm still on the search for a tag org creation system.  Hopefully someone has already done all the work for me. : )
