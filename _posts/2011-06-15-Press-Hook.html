<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9242342847865075" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">More editing and editing to be done it seems. &nbsp;I was working a good portion of my morning on our &lsquo;Press Hook&rsquo; as they are so named. &nbsp;Thank you </span><a href="http://arstechnica.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ars Technica</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> for providing a great article on how to do so. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The more I work to build the business, the more I realize just how many times I need to redo my work. &nbsp;I learn what I want (first and hardest step really), then I figure out how to make it, and then I make sure that the message is consistent. &nbsp;With this process the content is slowly but surely getting up on the web, but as it gets created I realize all the other changes/edits I want to make to make it all look better...ah work. &nbsp;It never really leaves.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For example: when I created my &lsquo;Press Hook&rsquo; I went through three phases. &nbsp;The first was collecting basic information about what I wanted, with some research. &nbsp;The second was doing more research on how to write a &lsquo;Press Hook&rsquo; and writing up a more thoroughly detailed one. &nbsp;The third was skimping down the thorough second run back into something the Press might want to read. &nbsp;More, something short and sweet and to the point but includes all the important pieces.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Proud of the final result, but took a bit more brain power than I wish it had. &nbsp;</span></div>
